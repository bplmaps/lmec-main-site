### Next-generation georeferencing

**Allmaps** is a next-generation software ecosystem that makes it easier and more fun to create, curate, and share [goereferenced maps](https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/digital-projects/georeferencing/). Using the [International Image Operability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/), Allmaps can warp and display scanned maps entirely in a web browser, without the need to download desktop GIS software like ArcGIS or QGIS.

In collaboration with the Allmaps development team and the [American Geographical Society Library](https://uwm.edu/libraries/2023/10/17/agsl-neh-grant/) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, the Leventhal Center leads an ongoing project focused on helping other map-holding institutions improve accessibility to their digital collections. Our focus areas include:
* **Internal feature development** within the Allmaps software ecosystem, including building new tools that will allow Allmaps users to manage crowdsourced georeferencing workflows at scale.
* **External feature development** beyond the Allmaps software ecosystem, including the creation of plugins for major content management systems like GeoBlacklight and CONTENTdm that will allow collections managers to easily include Allmaps in their digital discovery portals.
* **Social infrastructure development** that will support the maintenance and further development of Allmaps—and other tools like it that land at the intersection of geography and digital humanities—in perpetuity.

This work is supported by a [Digital Humanities Advancement Grant](https://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/digital-humanities-advancement-grants) from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/).
