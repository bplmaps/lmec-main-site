As of August 2021, our crowdsourced georeferencing interface is being phased out for a next generation replacement. You can still [browse maps that have been georeferenced](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?f%5Bgeoreferenced_bsi%5D%5B%5D=yes) or explore the fully-geotransformed [Atlascope collection](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org).
