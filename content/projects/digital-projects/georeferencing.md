{{< alert-box title="Retirement of Map Warper" >}}

As of August 2021, our crowdsourced georeferencing interface, Map Warper, is being phased out. Since then, the Map Center team has been supporting Bert Spaan's work on a next generation web georeferencing interface called [Allmaps](https://allmaps.org/), which will be ready for public use in fall 2022. You can still [browse maps that have been georeferenced](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?f%5Bgeoreferenced_bsi%5D%5B%5D=yes) or explore the fully-geotransformed [Atlascope collection](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org).

### What is georeferencing?

Georeferencing is the process of attaching coordinate data (latitude and longitude) to scanned images of maps. This allows anyone to easily compare scanned maps with modern geographies. Check out the Map Center's [Atlascope tool](http://leventhalmap.org/projects/digital-projects/atlascope/) for an example of georeferencing in action.

### How can I get started georeferencing?

It's easy! Here at the Map Center, we have a portal for guides and documentation called [Cartinal](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org). We've prepared a handy guide with instructions and resources for getting started with georeferencing.

### Where can I browse georeferenced LMEC maps?

That's easy too! At Cartinal, we also have a guide for accessing, browsing, and using georeferenced maps.

### I have another question...

... and we'll have another answer! Don't hesitate to reach out directly to our geospatial support team.
