### Do you need technical assistance on a cartographic project?

Our *Grants in Aid for Works in Progress* program supports researchers, teachers, members of the public, and community organizations in creating original cartographic and digital works.

Through this program, we support projects that meet two criteria: first, projects must be well-aligned with LMEC’s thematic focus areas; and, second, applicants must have a well-defined vision for their project and a specific request for what kind of technical or creative support will be required to bring the project to completion. Rather than a monetary stipend, successful applicants are awarded grant resources in the form of Leventhal Center staff support. (See our *[Fellowships and Research Support](/research/fellowships/)* page for other programs that offer monetary awards.)

Submit your application using the [form below](#apply-now). Applications are reviewed on a monthly basis and will be awarded based on the capacity of Leventhal Center staff time. You can examine [completed Grant in Aid projects](#archive-of-grant-in-aid-projects) at the bottom of this page.
