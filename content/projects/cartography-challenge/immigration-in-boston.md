## The Details

#### Topic: Immigration in Greater Boston

Your mission is simple: create a static map that creatively visualizes immigration patterns in the Greater Boston area ("Greater Boston" can be interpreted flexibly). The Center has relatively few maps that depict immigration in the Greater Boston region, and most of them are cut and dry choropleth maps that depict density by area. In this challenge, we're excited to see submissions that creatively and elegantly visualize immigration in unexpected ways.

#### Data: 2020 American Community Survey: 5-year (2016-2020)

The 2020 Census brought us a wealth of new data, including data on immigration in the US. This Cartography Challenge focuses on foreign-born population data at the Census tract level from the American Community Survey's (ACS) 5-year estimates from 2016-2020. After downloading this data from [NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/), we did some light processing to standardize field names and data types. Otherwise, it's been unchanged.

To get started with the data, [download it from our Data Portal](https://data.leventhalmap.org) for free. Applicants need not limit their submission to *only* this dataset---submissions are welcome to include additional data such as other Census tables or user-generated data. At minimum, though, submissions must include the 2016-2020 ACS 5-year estimates for foreign-born population.

In addition to the foreign-born population dataset, submissions should include a representation of Boston's neighborhoods (available for download from our [Data Portal](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkhq7glpx)). 

#### Challenge: No Choropleth, No Problem

{{< figure src="/images/blog/choropleth.png" alt="A screenshot of our digital collections portal with numerous choropleth maps" caption="Our [digital collections portal](https://collections.leventhalmap.org) is bursting at the seams with choropleth maps about immigration---help us!" class="figure-right" >}}

In our inaugural **Cartography Challenge**, we're looking for submissions that go beyond the choropleth map. While useful for visualizing differences across space, choropleth maps can [be especially misleading when it comes to data representation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-25/how-to-avoid-being-fooled-by-bad-maps).

At the Map Center, almost all of the immigration maps in our collections represent data through choropleth maps. We need a break from them, so for now, we're putting an embargo on the choropleth.

(Before you ask: yes, this embargo extends to [bivariate maps](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/bivariate-choropleth).)

## Evaluation

#### Rubric & Application

Submissions will be evaluated according to these five criteria:
| Criteria             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Topic conformity     | Does the submission creatively engage with the topic?                                                                                                                                        |
| Data integrity       | Does the submission use the correct dataset and include other appropriate information? Has the data been appropriately represented within the confines of the story that the map is telling? |
| Challenge creativity | How has the submission responded the Challenge prompt?                                                                                                                                       |
| Cartographic design  | Does the submission follow reasonable design principles, or perhaps break with them in generative, exciting ways? Does the submission follow best practices in accessible design?            |
| Educational capacity | Is the submission visually engaging for a wide range of learners (e.g., young people, adults)? Can it be effectively used in teaching and public education?                                  |

An application consists of the following material submitted by **Monday, December 19, 2022 at 10pm ET**:

* One map---a minimum of 300 DPI at 10 inches---that appropriately responds to the present submission cycle's topic, data, and challenge themes (uploads or URLs in TIFF format)
* In the same document, 1) a technical statement of not more than 500 words describing the workflow used to create the map (if not already present in the map) and 2) a data bibliography (if not already present in the map)
* An indication of whether you would like your submission to be considered for accession into the [LMEC's Digital Collections](https://collections.leventhalmap.org) and licensed under a Creative Commons copyright

Don't hesitate to [reach out to us](mailto:ispangler@leventhalmap.org) if you have any questions about the submission process. Successful applicants will be notified by December 11, 2022.
