Many visitors to our Gallery come in with a question on their mind - what did Boston look like before it was filled in? When walking around Boston today, it might be hard to picture the tidal estuaries, shallow marshes, and mud flats that were filled in and topped with Brownstones and tall buildings.

Even as early at 1722, colonists had started to {{<popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161f22q/4878,520,4664,6027/full/0/default.jpg">}}change the outline of Boston {{</popup>}}. They built wharves into the harbor and created a mill dam over the northern inlet. By the turn of the 19th century, Boston's landfilling project had changed the shape of the coastline almost in its entirety. Neighborhoods like the Back Bay, Seaport, and even sections of downtown are all part of the filled-in territory.

There are many questions people ask about filled land: How much of it is fill? When was it filled in? And what did the shoreline used to look like? But 'where the water used to be' isn't just a modern question, historians at the turn of the 19th century were drawing depictions of the Shawmut peninsula and comparing the city of two centuries prior with it's then-current shape.

{{<figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:8k71nt56d/full/full/0/default.jpg" caption="_Boston Old and New_ appeared inside the first volume of Winsor's book, _Memorial History of Boston, Including Suffolk County, Massachusetts._" class="figure-left" >}}

In 1880, historian, librarian, and cartographer Justin Winsor created this map of "Boston Old and New". He overlayed the original Shawmut peninsula with the current reach of Boston, emphasizing {{<popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:8k71nt56d/2153,1006,1449,1300/full/0/default.jpg">}}the hills{{</popup>}} that {{<popup src ="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:6h441121b/full/full/0/default.jpg">}}were shortened{{</popup>}} to fill in sections of harbor and the distinctions between {{<popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:8k71nt56d/4734,3586,1548,922/full/0/default.jpg" >}} marshy and level ground {{</popup>}}.

Even as soon at 1880, none of Boston proper's original shoreline touched the water, ringed instead with wharves leading out to the harbor. Also visible on this map are the modern car bars, railroad tracks and trails through the public garden. The 'New' Boston looked quite different than the old, but the process didn't just happen immediately.

The 19th century was a busy time for Boston when it came to landmaking - similarly to Winsor's map, other overlays were created to contrast the difference between Modern Boston and the original Shawmut Peninsula. This 1895 map celebrates a century of Boston's expansion from 1793 to 1893. On this map Boston grows from the pink outline, then the green, and by 1893 - settling in the more familiar blue outline. On this map one can also see the two train lines, the Boston & Albany and the Boston & Providence, which {{<popup src = "https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:js956k46x/526,870,2995,1914/full/0/default.jpg">}}crossed the Back Bay{{</popup>}}and allowed for landfill to be easily transported into the city.

This overlay of Boston proper from around 1894 includes the streetcar and subway lines in Boston. At the time, almost all of the subway lines were on the original land of the Shawmut peninsula. You can see {{<popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1257b902s/1393,3023,716,484/full/0/default.jpg">}}here{{</popup>}} that the subway line extends off into filled land at the corner of the Boston Public Gardens before transitioning into a streetcar.

While the reason this map was made is unclear, the extension of the subway down Boylston Street needed different considerations for it's construction had to be made because of the groundwater level and softer soil. Knowing where Boston used to begin and end has practical applications as well.

Of course, our collective fascination with Boston's changing shoreline didn't end after the 1800s. [Many modern maps](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=Boston+shoreline&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=1950&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bend%5D=2022&commit=Apply) of Boston's landfill also have a home in our collections.

This much more modern map of Boston uses a satellite image as a base. On top, it overlays the city's landfill in three sections: the original land in red, land added before 1880 in gray and land added after - up until the base photo was taken - in blue. You can see that some of the last areas to be filled in were the [airport](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/olmsted-to-airport-east-boston-and-urban-development), the Seaport, and the South bay. This map also shows hints at some of the landfilling that occurred along the waterfront in Cambridge as well.

Even in centuries past, People wanted to know what was under their feet, whether they were plotting out subway lines, or trying to catalog where people’s houses were in 1635. As many people want to see what neighborhoods used to look like or what shorelines used to be in their specific neighborhoods, they may turn to these overlays, georeferenced maps, or tools like [Atlascope](atlascope.leventhalmap.org). And today, the question of “where the water was” becomes more relevant, with rising seas having the potential to reclaim areas that were once water again.

Overlaying Boston's shoreline with it's moderns landscapes is a great way for people to picture and understand Boston of the past. And next time you want to know where the water was - just look at one of these maps. You're not the first one to ask!
