When we're in the library in person, there are few activities as rewarding as looking at a map spread out on a table, talking about what we can see and inviting students, researchers, or visitors to look closely while we explore historical geography.

Hopefully within the next several months, we'll be back to seeing maps in this way. But luckily for us, we have an amazing collection of digitized materials—which makes it possible to experiment with research, narration, and interpretation framed through the window of a web browser.

Our latest tool that we've built for exploring our collections online is called "Moviemaps." It's built to solve a challenge: how can we narrate around a digitized map while still giving the viewer freedom to control and explore the view themselves? Embedding an image of a map into a video itself can be interesting, but it lacks depth; often the resolution is too low to see the map's detail, and of course the viewer can't change what's in view.

With Moviemaps, we pair a video discussion with digital collections objects that are zooming and panning around in sync with the video—but which the viewer can also explore on their own, pausing the video to get deeper into a map or to look at a different section.

As a first trial of this new interface, I've put together a five-minute video exploring one of my absolute favorite newly-digitized maps, a 1905 trolley wayfinder. [Watch the video and explore yourself](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/movie-maps/#trolley-wayfinder). When you're done, let us know what maps you want to see us discuss next: tag us [@bplmaps](https://twitter.com/bplmaps) or [send us a message](/about/contact-connect).
