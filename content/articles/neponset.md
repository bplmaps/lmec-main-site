On Monday, March 14, 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [announced](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0102204&doc=Y&colid=39520&region=01&type=SC) the addition of the Lower Neponset River to the [Superfund National Priorities List](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-national-priorities-list-npl)—a designation that comes after decades of local advocacy efforts and will provide federal resources for a thorough environmental hazard investigation and cleanup project.

The EPA’s decision draws from studies conducted in the early 2000s that determined “the river contains sediment contaminated with elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that may pose a risk to human health and/or the environment.” PCBs, [man-made organic chemicals consisting of carbon, hydrogen and chlorine atoms](https://www.epa.gov/pcbs/learn-about-polychlorinated-biphenyls-pcbs#what), first came into production in 1929 and were mainly used in industrial and commercial applications. Although banned in 1979, PCBs can remain in environments for long periods of time—generally accumulating in air, water, soil, plants, and fish—and have been linked to serious health effects.

### An early industrial river

The Neponset River has been home to a string of local industries since the seventeenth century. Early industries—producing flour, gun powder, paper, lumber, and chocolate—relied on the river for a supply of water, a space for dumping waste, and a source of power for manufacturing infrastructure like mills and dams. 

Many of these mills were concentrated in today's historically-designated Dorchester-Milton Lower Mills Industrial District, which appears in great detail on this 1890 pictorial [map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633ff663) of by O.H Bailey & Co.
