On Monday, March 14, 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [announced](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0102204&doc=Y&colid=39520&region=01&type=SC) the addition of the Lower Neponset River to the [Superfund National Priorities List](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-national-priorities-list-npl)—a designation that comes after decades of local advocacy efforts and will provide federal resources for a thorough environmental hazard investigation and cleanup project.

The EPA’s decision draws from studies conducted in the early 2000s that determined “the river contains sediment contaminated with elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that may pose a risk to human health and/or the environment.” PCBs, [man-made organic chemicals consisting of carbon, hydrogen and chlorine atoms](https://www.epa.gov/pcbs/learn-about-polychlorinated-biphenyls-pcbs#what), first came into production in 1929 and were mainly used in industrial and commercial applications. Although banned in 1979, PCBs can remain in environments for long periods of time—generally accumulating in air, water, soil, plants, and fish—and have been linked to serious health effects.

### An early industrial river

{{< figure src="/uploads/2022-04-04/industries.jpg" caption="A 1954 [study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25080477?seq=1) by Edward Pierce Hamilton estimates 18 mills lined the Neponset by 1800." class="figure-right" >}}

Industrial activity along the Neponset dates back centuries before the introduction of PCBs in the twentieth century. Early local industries relied on the river for a supply of water, a space for dumping waste, and a source of power for manufacturing infrastructure like mills and dams.

Many of these mills—supporting the production of flour, gun powder, paper, lumber, and chocolate—were concentrated in today's historically-designated Dorchester-Milton Lower Mills Industrial District and appear in great detail on this 1890 pictorial [map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633ff663) of by the O.H Bailey & Co.

For example, Boston's very own Wonka Chocolate Factory (actually named Walter Baker Chocolate Company) is prominently featured along the {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633ff67c/3044,4783,3016,936/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank" >}} map's border{{</popup>}} and distinguished by the numbers {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633ff67c/5107,3062,1360,1196/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank" >}} 14,{{</popup>}} {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633ff67c/3883,3478,744,728/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank" >}} 15, and 16 {{</popup>}} on the map's physical landscape. How did an early chocolate business settle along the Neponset? In 1764, a young Irish immigrant named John Hannon [approached local mill owners](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fearlybirdpower.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F04%2FSWEET_HISTORY_2005.pdf&chunk=true) with a request to harness water power for a new chocolate-making technique he learned in London. No mill owners were particularly enthusiastic about the idea, but a wealthy man named James Baker jumped on the idea as a prospective business opportunity, and on March 8, 1765, Hannon—financed by Baker—began making chocolate in a saw mill powered by the Neponset.
