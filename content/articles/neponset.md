On Monday, March 14, 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) [announced](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.scs&id=0102204&doc=Y&colid=39520&region=01&type=SC) the addition of the Lower Neponset River to the [Superfund National Priorities List](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-national-priorities-list-npl)—a designation that comes after decades of local advocacy efforts and will provide federal resources for a thorough environmental hazard investigation and cleanup project.

The EPA’s decision draws from studies conducted in the early 2000s that determined “the river contains sediment contaminated with elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that may pose a risk to human health and/or the environment.” PCBs, [man-made organic chemicals consisting of carbon, hydrogen and chlorine atoms](https://www.epa.gov/pcbs/learn-about-polychlorinated-biphenyls-pcbs#what), first came into production in 1929 and were mainly used in industrial and commercial applications. Although banned in 1979, PCBs can remain in environments for long periods of time—generally accumulating in air, water, soil, plants, and fish—and have been linked to serious health effects.

### An early industrial river

{{< figure src="/uploads/2022-04-04/industries.jpg" caption="A 1954 [study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25080477?seq=1) by Edward Pierce Hamilton estimates 18 mills lined the Neponset by 1800." class="figure-right" >}}

Industrial activity along the Neponset dates back centuries before the introduction of PCBs in the 1930s. Early local industries relied on the river for a supply of water, a space for dumping waste, and a source of power for manufacturing infrastructure like mills and dams. 

Many of these mills—supporting the production of flour, gun powder, paper, lumber, and chocolate—were concentrated in today's Dorchester-Milton Lower Mills Industrial District and Upper Falls area, and appear in great detail on this 1890 pictorial [map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633ff663) by the O.H Bailey & Co. The map also labels 49 points of interest, including a branch of the {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633ff67c/7046,2982,636,585/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank" >}} Boston Public Library, {{</popup>}} the {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633ff67c/5170,3101,416,442/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank" >}} Milton School of Music, {{</popup>}} and the {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633ff67c/3758,3901,539,304/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank" >}} Milton News Office.{{</popup>}}

Let's take a closer look at two of the river's early industrial facilities.

##### The local paper boy\[s\]

 {{< figure src="/uploads/2022-04-12/paper-mill1.jpeg" caption="This [map](https://www.dorchesteratheneum.org/project/neponset-river-mills/) from Howard Wallingford's _Papermaking on the Neponset_ cites the 1728 Act for the Encouragement of Making Paper." class="figure-right" >}}

Though one of the oldest and most successful industries, paper production along the river was born out of necessity during 

* paper shortage? 

is one of the river's oldest industries. In 1728, the [Massachusetts legislature](https://digital.hagley.org/08009787_Tileston_Hollingsworth?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=841a10b040f90636a0a5&solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=0) "issued a charter to Thomas Hancock...and others...to set up a paper mill on the Neponset." Production began in 1731 and papermaking has had a home along the river ever since. 

Almost 50 years later, in 1773, a new name entered the picture. [George Clark](https://www.google.com/books/edition/American_Paper_Mills_1690_1832/vrbuwbBJZrQC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=george+clark+paper+mill+boston&pg=PA94&printsec=frontcover) began construction of a paper mill on the remnants of a lumber mill but did not have much business success. Over the next 30 years, the mill bounced from [Abigail Quincy](https://www.google.com/books/edition/American_Paper_Mills_1690_1832/vrbuwbBJZrQC?hl=en&gbpv=0), to Patrick Connor and William Sumner, and finally to Edmund Tileston and Mark Hollingsworth of the Tileston and Hollingsworth Co., pictured on the {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633ff67c/6798,4660,1428,880/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank" >}} map's border {{</popup>}} and {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633ff67c/1833,2611,1321,994/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank" >}} along the river.{{</popup>}} The partnership saw overwhelming success and continued to [buy, lease, and build](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanantiquarian.org%2FFindingaids%2Ftileston_and_hollingsworth.pdf&clen=34949&chunk=true) additional mills on the river to support paper production into the twentieth century.

##### Willy Wonka and the Neponset River

Moving downstream, Boston's very own Wonka Chocolate Factory (a.k.a. the Walter Baker Chocolate Company) is also featured along the {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633ff67c/3044,4783,3016,936/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank" >}} map's border{{</popup>}} and distinguished by the numbers {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633ff67c/5107,3062,1360,1196/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank" >}} 14,{{</popup>}} {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633ff67c/3883,3478,744,728/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank" >}} 15, and 16 {{</popup>}} on the map's physical landscape.

How did this early chocolate business come to settle along the Neponset? In 1764, a young Irish immigrant named John Hannon [approached local mill owners](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fearlybirdpower.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F04%2FSWEET_HISTORY_2005.pdf&chunk=true) with a request to harness water power for a new chocolate-making technique he learned in London. No mill owners were particularly enthusiastic about the idea, but a general store owner named James Baker jumped on the idea as a prospective business opportunity. On March 8, 1765, Hannon began making chocolate in a saw mill financed by Baker and powered by the Neponset. Baker took full ownership of the business after Hannon disappeared in 1779, and the Baker name ran the Boston chocolate scene until 1965, when operations moved to Delaware.
