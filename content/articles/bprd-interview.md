> This article is a part of our series, **Get to Know Your Data**, where we talk to the people and institutions that create, store, and share geospatial data. Here, we ask about how they engage with publics and grapple with the social lives of the data that they manage.


When you think about public resources like open space, trees, shady areas, benches and tables, accessible public restrooms, or somewhere you can go to be physically active, what questions come to mind? Maybe you're thinking about the immediacy of your day; where you can go to augment yours and your loved ones' physical and mental health. Or maybe, you wonder about bigger questions, related to issues of equity when it comes to [third places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place). For instance, where do these places exist? And who is able to access them?

At the Leventhal Map & Education Center, we are interested in exploring *how* the people at our public institutions capture your thoughts and opinions about public resources in the official surveys, studies, and datasets they use to drive civic life. 

In this article, we speak with the Principal Research Analyst at the City of Boston's Parks Department, Maggie Owens. Last year, as part of our May 2020 *Angles on Bending Lines* discussion series, [Maggie talked with us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gREz3nzHJhA) about how data can be used to tell competing versions of the truth. Today, our discussion focuses on the attitudes and practices of the Boston Parks and Recreation Department (BPRD) as they strive to responsibly and meaningfully manage public datasets.

To aid in the discussion, we are also joined by City of Boston analysts who work on issues of public accessibilty. Charlotte [last name] is the [title], and manages the spatial data and GIS tools available via Analyze Boston. Joyce John is the city's official Story Mapper, and has created numerous [digital mapping tools for public exploration](https://boston.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Shortlist/index.html?appid=93ab1191a7b34644a9733c1aa5926727).
