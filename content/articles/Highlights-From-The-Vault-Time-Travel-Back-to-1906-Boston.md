> *On October 11, we hosted **From The Vault: Time Travel Back to 1906 Boston***.

During this edition of From the Vault, we had the iconic 1906 film Seeing Boston playing in our classroom, accompanied by maps, photos, and other objects from BPL Special Collections that helped animate the places seen in the film. Be sure to read the two accompanying articles: [Time Travel Back to 1906 Boston](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/time-travel-back-to-1906-boston/) and Riding Around 1906 Boston.

##### Poole, A. F. ***[Twentieth century Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633fc36z)*** (1905)

This image shows the “New Boston” of 1905 – a downtown filled with high-rise office and other commercial buildings where shops and homes had stood a few years earlier. The artist who created the map is Albert F. Poole (1853-1934). In addition to bird’s eye views of places throughout New England, he created paintings and served as a newspaper editor.

The image shows Boston as seen from the East and clearly depicts the clustering of tall, modern buildings in the central business district. At the bottom left we see South Station, and the warehouses and manufacturing buildings constructed after the fire of 1872.

Note how the commercial aspects of the city seem to dominate. The Old North Church, then as now considered one of Boston's signature historic sites, is barely visible at the right, even though its steeple was only a few feet shorter that the Ames Building, then Boston’s tallest. You also have to look closely to spot the gold dome of the State House. In Back Bay, M.I.T. is just one of a row of buildings on Boylston Street, all we see of the then new Boston Public Library is its roof, and the Museum of Fine Arts appears not to be there at all.

This view of Boston was chosen as the central illustration in a 1907 Chamber of Commerce flyer describing Boston as “The Best City in the United States to Live in, to Do Business in, and to Visit.”

**Things to Consider:**

* What is the cartographer trying to do with this map? Create a record of what the city looked like; make a decorative artwork; convey a message about the city?
* How might a bird’s eye view map created of Boston  today be similar to and different from this one?

This page is a print-out of an important step in mapmaking, which is laying out the important informative elements of a map (title block, credits, north arrow, scale bar, etc.) so that they don’t interfere with the content of the map. Computerized map production meant it was trivial to create visualizations of the same dataset for different locations, seen here with the same types of information displayed for various coastal towns of Massachusetts. This page only shows the outlines of the towns and the orange and green marks show an unnamed editor's ideas for where the title block and credits, respectively, could be located for each map.

##### MassGIS ***[Mashpee land use change 1971-1990](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:gx41sm16g)*** (1991)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:ft84fs153/full/,850/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map shows the ways that land use changed over two decades in the Massachusetts town of Mashpee. As with other maps of this time period, the map is in many ways secondary in importance to the data table of land use statistics printed on the bottom of the sheet. One notable part of this map is that the cartographers took time to create two “Change” views that can visually help guide a viewer towards an understanding of the difference between two moments in time.

##### MassGIS ***[The Appalachian trail in Massachusetts](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rx918q84f)*** (1991)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:pc28gk205/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map is an incredibly sophisticated example of the complicated layouts and visualizations that could be achieved using the mapmaking softwares of the early 1990s. What is noteworthy from our perspective, however, is how the cartographer (noted as “MT” in the bottom left hand corner) left his humorous mark on the piece. “MT” is Mike Terner, a former employee of Applied Geographics, Inc., which was contracted by MassGIS to make maps throughout the 1990s and Mike left small linework visualizations of hikers scattered across the page — a creative way to add visual interest while working within the confines of printing technology at the time.

##### Geological Survey (U.S.). National Mapping Division ***[Index to 1:24,000-scale digital line graph (DLG) and digital elevation model (DEM) data](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7d27fs716)*** (1995)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:2v241v11d/full/,850/0/default.jpg" >}}

This map was created as a reference poster for folks working with federal spatial data and would have been useful to discover what kinds of datasets existed for places across the United States. In the map, the country has been divided into a large grid and each “cell” (or individual rectangle) of the grid has symbols that show what kinds of datasets were completed (red background with black symbols) or in progress (white background with green symbols) for each part of the country. Visualizations of digital elevation models can be seen in Views of Cape Ann and The Appalachian trail in Massachusetts.

##### MassGIS ***[GIS mapping of risk factors for eastern equine encephalitis](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rv047v771)*** (1991)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:5x220j19j/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="" >}}

This set of maps was created in 1991 as the State of Massachusetts faced increased risk of eastern equine encephalitis (Triple E virus) spreading, with each map showing a different variable for the same geographic extent. Public health applications are still one of the most common uses for making maps using computers. Earlier tin 2024, this same virus was making headlines for confirmed cases in the state!

##### MassGIS ***[Digital orthography checkplots](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rj435666w)*** (2000)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cv43tx62n/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This graphic is a helpful visual to understand the different resolutions of aerial imagery and which scales are most useful for different planning and land use studies. It’s important to note that when this poster was produced, the standard form of imagery like this would have been aerial imagery that was produced through dozens of hours of plane flights across the state of Massachusetts. Today, this method of creating land use imagery is still used, but is now also augmented by the increasing availability of satellite imagery.

##### MassGIS ***[EOEA MassGIS geographic information system transition document](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:dn402997f)*** (1990)

This document was produced by Applied Geographics, Inc. as a tool for MassGIS to be able to bridge a technology transition to primarily computer-led workflows for making maps across the agency. This document is a collection of visualizations of statewide datasets that can be used in different contexts and examples of maps made for different specific applications. Of particular interest are the descriptions and definitions listed above that give administrative context for why this document was created.
