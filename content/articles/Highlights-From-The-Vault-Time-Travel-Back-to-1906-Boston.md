> *On October 11, we hosted **From The Vault: Time Travel Back to 1906 Boston***.

During this edition of From the Vault, we had the iconic 1906 film Seeing Boston playing in our classroom, accompanied by maps, photos, and other objects from BPL Special Collections that helped animate the places seen in the film. Be sure to read the two accompanying articles: [Time Travel Back to 1906 Boston](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/time-travel-back-to-1906-boston/) and Riding Around 1906 Boston.

##### Poole, A. F. ***[Twentieth century Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633fc36z)*** (1905)

This image shows the “New Boston” of 1905 – a downtown filled with high-rise office and other commercial buildings where shops and homes had stood a few years earlier. The artist who created the map is Albert F. Poole (1853-1934). In addition to bird’s eye views of places throughout New England, he created paintings and served as a newspaper editor.

The image shows Boston as seen from the East and clearly depicts the clustering of tall, modern buildings in the central business district. At the bottom left we see South Station, and the warehouses and manufacturing buildings constructed after the fire of 1872.

Note how the commercial aspects of the city seem to dominate. The Old North Church, then as now considered one of Boston's signature historic sites, is barely visible at the right, even though its steeple was only a few feet shorter that the Ames Building, then Boston’s tallest. You also have to look closely to spot the gold dome of the State House. In Back Bay, M.I.T. is just one of a row of buildings on Boylston Street, all we see of the then new Boston Public Library is its roof, and the Museum of Fine Arts appears not to be there at all.

This view of Boston was chosen as the central illustration in a 1907 Chamber of Commerce flyer describing Boston as “The Best City in the United States to Live in, to Do Business in, and to Visit.”

**Things to Consider:**

* What is the cartographer trying to do with this map? Create a record of what the city looked like; make a decorative artwork; convey a message about the city?
* How might a bird’s eye view map created of Boston  today be similar to and different from this one?

##### George W. Bromley and Walter S. Bromley [Atlas of the city of Boston : Boston proper and Back Bay : from actual surveys and official plans](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:tt44pv96w) (1908)

Insurance companies need to be able to assess risk when setting premiums. For urban property insurance, this involves such factors as the proximity of fire houses, roads and water lines to the insured property, together with the type of construction and use of the covered building and its neighbors. This information became increasingly challenging to obtain as insurers extended their underwriting beyond their local communities.

Companies like Bromley filled this need by compiling and publishing atlases with this information, and updating them regularly to keep the information current. One of the earliest U.S. atlases was the Insurance Map of Boston, Volume 1, 1867, by D. A. Sanborn. We tend to think of the economic value of data as a twenty-first century phenomenon, but these atlases show how essential information was to commerce well over a century ago.

The Bromley Atlas seen here provides essential information for following the path of the streetcar in Seeing Boston, including the location of specific buildings, their height and street numbers. The areas seen in Seeing Boston are covered by Plates 1, 6, 11, 12, 19, 20, 21 and 23.

Things to Consider:

* Do you think the people who created these maps would be surprised to learn that historians and others trying to understand their world are looking at their work in the year 2024?
* If you could go back in time, what additional information would you include in these maps to make them more useful to future generations?

##### Arthur Leslie Plimpton, John J. Lane, and Geo. H. Walker [Central part of Boston Elevated Railway system showing connections](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:pc28d1639) (1904)

When Seeing Boston was released in 1906, streetcars were everywhere. There was even a New England Street Railway Club, which published a guide that covered the entire region. It’s said that with a number of transfers and connections one could make it all the way from Boston to New York by streetcar.

The connection notations at the periphery of the map highlight the seamless nature of this network. The end of each line connects to one or more lines serving more distant locations.

The title of this map seems confusing at first since it includes subway and surface streetcar lines as well as elevated trains. But, “Boston Elevated Railway” refers to the name of the private company that ran all services, not to the trains that ran on elevated tracks. Rapid transit in Boston was operated by private businesses until the 1940s.

The reverse of the map gives detailed routes within the city of Boston and enables us to follow the streetcar in Seeing Boston. It’s also interesting to read the advertisements at the top and bottom, including those for a veterinary book on home treatment of horses and cattle, and Dr. Harrison’s Peristaltic Lozenges, that were pleasant tasting and apparently cured everything from appendicitis to pimples and loss of appetite.

Things to Consider:

* Why were streetcars replaced by buses?
* How did the location and extension of streetcar lines influence the development of the Boston region?

##### Geo. H. Walker & Co. [View of Boston freight terminals, the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:df65xz27g) (1903)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:d791w527w/full/,1600/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

To Bostonians of 1906, it would have been a source of civic pride and promise of prosperity, for the South Station complex was said to be the largest railroad terminal in the United States or the world, depending on the source. This would have been extremely significant at a time when railroads accounted for the preponderance of intercity transport, both passenger and freight. Given the number of competing modes of transport today, it can be difficult for us to appreciate how dependent our ancestors were on railroads.

At the time it opened, the station was called South Union Station, the word “union” indicating that it was served by more than one railroad. For today’s Bostonians, perhaps the most informative thing about this map is that it illustrates why the land at the lower left, site of today’s Federal Courthouse, is called Fan Pier.

Things to Consider:

* How many of the buildings shown in this map are still there today?
* Of the buildings still standing, how many are used for the same purpose as they were in 1906?
* Of the buildings whose use has changed, how many are now used as offices, research facilities, storage, and residences?

This map was created as a reference poster for folks working with federal spatial data and would have been useful to discover what kinds of datasets existed for places across the United States. In the map, the country has been divided into a large grid and each “cell” (or individual rectangle) of the grid has symbols that show what kinds of datasets were completed (red background with black symbols) or in progress (white background with green symbols) for each part of the country. Visualizations of digital elevation models can be seen in Views of Cape Ann and The Appalachian trail in Massachusetts.

##### MassGIS ***[GIS mapping of risk factors for eastern equine encephalitis](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rv047v771)*** (1991)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:5x220j19j/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="" >}}

This set of maps was created in 1991 as the State of Massachusetts faced increased risk of eastern equine encephalitis (Triple E virus) spreading, with each map showing a different variable for the same geographic extent. Public health applications are still one of the most common uses for making maps using computers. Earlier tin 2024, this same virus was making headlines for confirmed cases in the state!

##### MassGIS ***[Digital orthography checkplots](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rj435666w)*** (2000)

This graphic is a helpful visual to understand the different resolutions of aerial imagery and which scales are most useful for different planning and land use studies. It’s important to note that when this poster was produced, the standard form of imagery like this would have been aerial imagery that was produced through dozens of hours of plane flights across the state of Massachusetts. Today, this method of creating land use imagery is still used, but is now also augmented by the increasing availability of satellite imagery.

This document was produced by Applied Geographics, Inc. as a tool for MassGIS to be able to bridge a technology transition to primarily computer-led workflows for making maps across the agency. This document is a collection of visualizations of statewide datasets that can be used in different contexts and examples of maps made for different specific applications. Of particular interest are the descriptions and definitions listed above that give administrative context for why this document was created.
