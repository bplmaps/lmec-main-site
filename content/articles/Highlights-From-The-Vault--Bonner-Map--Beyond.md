> *On May 30, we hosted **From The Vault — Bonner Map & Beyond.***

Originally drawn in 1722, the map commonly referred to as the “Bonner map” was the first printed map of Boston.

Titled “The town of Boston in New England,” the map details the locations of streets, churches, and town buildings in pre-Revolutionary Boston. Its incredible level of detail made it a popular reference map for future mapmakers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

In this From The Vault, we explored the Bonner map’s evolution over a half-century and its enduring cartographic influence into the twentieth century.

#### John Bonner, [The town of Boston in New England](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161f21f) \[1723–1733]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161f22q/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This 1723 map is a copy of the 1722 map created by Captain John Bonner, an English soldier who was a skilled navigator and celebrated mariner in colonial-era Boston. Bonner's map is considered the oldest surviving map of Boston and is thus typically referred to as [the first printed map of the city](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161f21f). 

Reflective of the importance of his occupation to Boston’s economy, the Bonner map highlights docks, wharves, ropewalks, and shipyards. In addition, the map reveals other priorities of Bostonian life at the time: tracking illnesses and fires; locating places of religion and education; and in general how one may navigate around Boston. Most notably to modern viewers, this map depicts Boston in its original peninsular shape. 

#### William Burgis, [To His Excellency William Burnet, Esqr., this Plan of Boston in New England is humbly dedicated](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633fb32n) (1869)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633fb33x/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

In [the fourth version of Bonner’s 1722 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633fb32n), William Burgis took on a more decorative approach to the design of his map in dedication to acting Massachusetts governor, William Burnet, in 1728. Bonner’s one-dimensional depictions of houses were replaced with hatching in place of important buildings, though churches and important public sites were given more detail. By shifting the map's layout and orientation, Burgis was able to add the ornate cartouche depicting three Greco-roman figures seated. 

Notably, the base of the statue shows the notable sites (including newly built churches) and list of "great fires" shown in Bonner's 1722 map, but is missing the dated list of smallpox outbreaks. Despite the divergences from the original, Burgis’ map still depicted an accurate picture of life in 18th-century Boston, enough so that it was reissued multiple times in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, including this facsimile issued in 1869.

#### William Price and John Bonner, [A new plan of ye great town of Boston in New England in America, with the many additionall buildings & new streets to the year 1743](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161952m) (1743)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161953w/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This 1743 Price map is the seventh version, or state, of Bonner’s 1722 map. William Price, a businessman and shopkeeper from pre-Revolutionary Boston, released seven of the nine "states"—or editions—of Bonner’s map. Originally, Price’s name was featured on the second and third states alongside Bonner’s name as part of a successful re-release of Bonner’s successful original. By the fifth state, Price omitted Bonner’s name, which is not seen on this map. '=

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161952m) is noticeably “busier” than both Bonner’s original map and earlier states of Price maps, with the note on Faneuil Hall marketplace extending into one of the original ships sketched in Bonner's original. Another curious detail is Price’s neglect in updating Boston’s age from “103” years, showing just how quickly new states must have been issued. This new state does accurately reflect the changing political landscape of the city, featuring twelve political wards, instead of the eight wards featured in the Burgis map. 

#### Steeger, *[Nuova pianta degli scavi di Pompei](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:n8710p92x)* (1862)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:n8710p936/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Located at the southeastern base of Mount Vesuvius, the ruins of the ancient city of Pompeii were discovered in the late 16th century; however, serious archaeological excavations did not begin at the site until the mid-18th century. The city had been "preserved in time" for nearly 1,700 years after Vesuvius exploded in 79 CE and buried the site in nearly 23 feet of volcanic debris.

[The 1862 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:n8710p92x) displayed here illustrates the excavations of Pompeii as they existed at that time, and lists 95 points of interest, including the Forum (65), the Triangular Forum (84) and the Amphitheatre (89).

#### W\.B. Clarke, *[Plan of ancient Rome](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fn85r)* (1830)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fn861/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This early-19th century map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fn85r) illustrates ancient Rome, where numerous scenes from Antony and Cleopatra (a play by Shakespeare) unfolded, and includes depictions of the monuments to be found throughout the city. Rome was the capital of the Roman Empire, which stretched nearly 1.7 million miles from Britain and Spain to Syria. In the late 1st and early 2nd centuries, Ancient Rome had reached its peak and it’s believed the city had a population of one million people, though this number is a possible overestimation.

The modern city of Rome is the capital of Italy and is home to over 4.2 million residents, making it one of the largest cities by population in all of Europe. Rome's history spans 28 centuries and fell under many different forms of leadership.

***Though the city has remained in name for over 2800 years, is it still the same place it was all that time ago?***

#### Christiaan van Adrichem, *[Ierusalem, et suburbia eius, sicut tempore Christi floruit c\[um\] locis, in quib\[us\] Christ\[us\] pass\[us\] est: que religiose a Christianis obseruata, etiam n\[um\] venerationi habent](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:2b88qf58d)* \[1584–1588]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:2b88qf59p/full/,1500/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Rather than a birds eye view, this depiction is more of [a pictorial map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:2b88qf58d), showing the facades of buildings placed adjacent to the streets and not drawn in perspective. As the extended title indicates, the map was compiled by Adrichem, a Dutch theologian and cartographer, to depict Jerusalem at the time of Christ.

The original map, with a horizontal format, was oriented with west at top. The map was later rotated to a vertical format, placing north at the top. The map presents an imaginary conception of the city, with many buildings depicted as 16th century European structures. In addition there are 270 numbered and captioned scenes, showing sites or events mentioned in the Bible and other historical texts. Many record events surrounding the life and crucifixion of Jesus, but a few date back even further.
