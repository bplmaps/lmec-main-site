> On February 15, we hosted From The Vault: Literary Landscapes! From The Vault is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. For this edition of the series, we explored the worlds of some of the most iconic landscapes of storytelling! From Sherlock Holmes to Winnie the Pooh, we examined the ways literature uses maps to strengthen the impact of storytelling.

##### Anna Beeck, [Plan de la ville de Bouchain situé sur les rivieres de la Sensette, et de l'Escaut, dans le comté de Hainaut](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n429w) (1711)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:q524nh86s/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n429w) is published by one of the earliest female publishers/cartographers and shows military positions and lines of attack during the siege of Bouchain in 1711. Beeck was a prolific mapmaker, printer, and publisher in a time when women were rarely involved in these trades.

##### Mary E. Johonnot,[ United States](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:2z10wv35v) (1822)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:2z10wv364/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

During the late 18th and early 19th century, it was common practice for American female students attending private academies to prepare maps of various parts of the world by copying maps from books or atlases. Most often, girls were taught by female instructors, who drew maps themselves to demonstrate geographic, artistic and design skills to their pupils. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:2z10wv35v) of the United States, drawn by Mary E. Johonnot of Boston, was most likely compiled in the 1820s as a school geography project, and was based on an earlier map as evidenced by the missing borders of Arkansas and Missouri.

##### National Woman Suffrage Pub. Co., Inc., [Victory Map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x059cd797) (1918)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x059cd800/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

This [outline map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x059cd797) of the contiguous United States shows the status of woman suffrage in each state circa 1918, just 2 years before the 19th amendment granted women the right to vote. It’s important to note that while the 19th amendment was passed in 1920, many women were barred voting access until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 

##### Elizabeth Shurtleff and Helen F. McMillin, [A Map of the Bermuda Islands](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463854q) (1930)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f4638550/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Women were very active in the production of pictorial maps in the early 20th century. These whimsical maps frequently focused on travel and tourism. Bordered by a ribbon of ocean creatures, [this 1930 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463854q) of Bermuda illustrates various methods of transportation from horse-drawn carriages to pirate ships and airplanes. On shore, tourism reigns with beaches, golf courses, tennis courts, shooting ranges and historic forts. Designed by Elizabeth Shurtleff and Helen McMillin, who studied at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts and Wellesley College respectively, this map encourages visits to the island by promoting recreation and history.

##### Marie Tharp and Bruce Heezen, [Physiographic Diagram of the Western Pacific Ocean](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4730543) (1971)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Untitled (30).png" >}}

Oceanographic cartographer and geologist Marie Tharp, along with her research partner Bruce Heezen, created [the first map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4730543) of the entire ocean floor. Heezen was credited solely for their work for years, and only later on did Tharp gain her rightful place in the cartographic world (though Tharp simply credited as a contributor in the BPL catalog). Early editions of ocean floor mapping feature an informal sketch style, while later final editions were sophisticated physical maps with color and shading, applied to reveal the dramatic mid-ocean canyons highlighting the continental divisions of the globe. Numbers on the map indicate depth of the ocean floor and elevations of individual undersea mountains.

##### Valerie S. Goodwin, [City Grid IV](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C5709931) (2007, Reproduction, 2015)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Untitled (31).png" class="" >}}

The adventures of Arthur Conan Doyle’s eccentric detective Sherlock Holmes are illustrated on [this late 20th-century pictorial poster](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4582145). Two magnifying glasses, containing maps of Victorian-era England and London, are numbered to identify locations associated with the Holmes stories. Illustrations from a number of tales surround the map, and feature characters such as Holmes’ loyal colleague Dr. John Watson, his adversary Professor Moriarty, and a vicious hound from The Hound of the Baskervilles.

##### Warner Bros. Entertainment, [Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot & Prongs Are Proud to Present the Marauder's Map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4681404) (2007)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Untitled (11).png" >}}

[This map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4681404) is from the iconic Harry Potter series and was created by the Marauders, a friend group consisting of  Remus Lupin (Moony), Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail), Sirius Black III (Padfoot), and Harry’s father, James Potter I (Prongs). In the Harry Potter universe, the map shows every classroom, hallway, and corner of Hogwarts, as well as every inch of the grounds, including secret passages hidden within the walls and the location of every person in the grounds, portrayed by a set of footprints.

##### Ernest H. Shepard, [Map of the 100-Acre Wood ](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C6350335)(2014)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Untitled (12).png" >}}

Christopher Robin, teddy bear Winnie-the-Pooh and other stuffed animals live in the 100-Acre Wood. The friends go on picnics, hunt heffalumps and have everyday adventures! [This map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C6350335) shows Christopher Robin’s house, his friends’ houses, and places they explored. Christopher Robin notes that Mr. Shepard “helpd” him draw the map. E. H. Shepard, who illustrated the books, based Winnie-the-Pooh on his own son’s stuffed bear.
