In the Spring 2021 semester, my urban history students at College of the
Holy Cross undertook a semester-long research project focused on the
history of the land currently filled by Boston's Rose Kennedy Greenway.
Before this land became the Greenway in recent years, it hosted an elevated highway—the
Central Artery, completed in 1959—and before that, it was filled with buildings and
streets.

We wanted to learn about the buildings, business owners,
residents, community groups, and infrastructure that occupied this land
before the construction of the highway. One of the most invaluable tools in our collective research project was the [Atlascope tool](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org) built by the Leventhal Map & Education Center. Each student investigated a single parcel of
land, and thanks to Atlascope, they were able to mine historic maps for
information about the buildings, businesses, and landowners on their
parcel. These findings empowered further research in historic
newspapers, genealogical records, and archival collections, allowing
them to paint detailed pictures of this corridor's past.

Together, my students and I built a [public history website](https://sites.google.com/holycross.edu/mmc) that uses Atlascope maps and other visual material to explore the displaced landscapes of the Central Artery corridor. Read below for
short student profiles spotlighting some of the most interesting research discoveries!

### Shoe and leather businesses on Albany St.

The 1922 Bromley Map led to key findings in my research of the history
of the parcel between 1-35 Albany St. After researching some of the
names found on this map, I found historical newspaper documents about
Jacob & Meyer Pearl, whose names are labelled on units 15-17 where I
learned that they owned and operated shoe wholesale stores on this
parcel. This led to further inquiry about the types of stores that
were found on this block, where I discovered this parcel's
relationship to the Leather District of Boston. Turns out this entire
block was filled with shoe and leather businesses up until the units
were demolished to make way for the construction of the Central
Artery.

### Fish oil on Atlantic Ave.

The history of Atlantic Avenue is in large part marked by the
prominence and success of the fish oil industry due to the plethora of
wharves and piers along the harbor, which have always been important
and identifying features of Boston as a coastal city. Here's an 1882
map of my parcel, and an image of Mercantile Wharf at the rear of
commercial buildings on Atlantic Avenue.

### Congestion in Clinton Market

Boston's urban framework inherently provoked mercantile activity.
Clinton Market housed this activity and was a landmark on the skyline
of the Financial District and North End due to its size and proximity
to the wharfs and Faneuil Market. The increased market congestion and
rush hour periods forced vendors to share the open floor plan of
Clinton Market, increase use of different modes of transportation,
such as horses and individual push carts, along with competitive
advertising.

### Brothels before the Big Dig

A series of domestic and hygiene artifacts excavated from the Big Dig
have been studied and traced back to 19th century private brothels on
my parcel at 27-29 Endicott Street. Although the establishment was
frequented by working class men, the site was operated and led by
various women, who took advantage of their social class and conditions
to eliminate any suspicions. Beyond moral and legal issues, there is a
deeper narrative regarding gender and class in the North End's 19th
century brothels as it allowed for women to have economic independence
and as well as a sense of power and ownership.

### An influential family's mark on the city

Owning the largest section within my South Market Street parcel
(55-121 South Market Street), "Josiah Quincy and Heirs" provides an
example of a historically wealthy family who influenced the City of
Boston and invested in the South Market mercantile and commercial
business area. Josiah Quincy III, former mayor of Boston and developer
of Quincy Market, owned several buildings within my parcel that were
soon passed down through generations of the Quincy Family. When
researching local newspapers, I was fortunate to discover the Quincy
patriarchal family tree showcased in a family feature in the Boston
Sunday Post in 1919.
