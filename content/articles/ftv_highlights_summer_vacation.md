> On July 7, we hosted [From The Vault: Summer Vacation](https://www.leventhalmap.org/event/from-the-vault-collections-showing-summer-vacation/)! From The Vault is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Map Center staff. For this edition the series, we looked at objects objects from our collections that map places of summer relaxation and recreation.

#### E. R. Howe, The Point of Pines, Revere, Mass (1880)

The Point of Pines, located just north of Boston, opened one year after this map’s publication in 1881. The Pines Hotel is promoted on the [map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3761342) as the “most beautiful sea shore resort in New England” where guests will enjoy “music day and evening,” “electric lights and fire works,” and “daily excursions and picnic parties without previous notice.” In addition to the hotel, developers made plans for a racetrack and amusement park on the property. Sounds like fun, right? Unfortunately, the amusement park never opened. After financial difficulties and lease transfers, work on the park came to a halt just two weeks before the scheduled opening in 1907.

#### George H. Walker, Magnolia, Gloucester, Mass (1887)

This [bird’s eye of the Magnolia, Gloucester](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f9030) details the neighborhood’s piers, beaches, cottages, chapel (C), and bowling alley (M)! In the foreground, Shore Street is lined with people walking and biking along the coast as boats sail nearby. The bicycles pictured are called penny-farthing (or high wheel) bicycles, which were particularly popular during the 1870s and 1880s when this map was first published. The large front wheel provided high speeds (large wheel rotation distance) and comfort (large shock absorption), but soon became obsolete with the development of modern bicycles in the late 1880s.
