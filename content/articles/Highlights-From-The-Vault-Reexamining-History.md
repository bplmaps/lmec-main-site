> *On January 24, we hosted **From The Vault: Reexamining History.***

This selection of maps and the captions associated were curated in response to [Percival Everett's James](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/19/1239377175/james-reimagines-twains-huckleberry-finn-with-mordant-humor-and-horror), a reimagining of Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn told from the enslaved Jim's point of view. The selections of this From the Vault encourage visitors to consider the very real events that took place during the novel's setting. How can maps help us reimagine and delve deeper into the literature we read? Explore this theme with us in this week's From the Vault: Reexamining History.

#### Warner Bros. Pictures (1923-1967), [The adventures of Mark Twain ](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm26c)(1944)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fm27n/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This promotional map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm26c) was made for the release of The Adventures of Mark Twain in 1944. The map functions more as a sentimental timeline of Twain’s life. Compare the Mississippi on this map with the new map of western rivers from 1851 also on view today. The Mississippi appears, like Twain’s life, as a straight and easy to navigate line.

#### G. W. Elliott, [Map of the United States, showing by colors the area of freedom and slavery, and the territories whose destiny is yet to be decided: exhibiting also the Missouri compromise line, and the routes of Colonel Fremont in his famous explorations: with important statistics of the free and slave states ](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:xg94j1990)(1856?)

> “We don’t even know where we are,” Norman said. “Bound to be a slave state on the other side of the river.” \
> ”Probably,” I said. “We’re slaves, Norman. Where we are is where we are.” \
> ”What’s that mean?” \
> ”I don’t know. Sounded better in my head.” \
> ”I know what it means,” Sammy said. “We’re slaves. We’re not anywhere. Free person, he can be where he wants to be. The only place we can ever be is in slavery.”

Published as a campaign poster supporting the Republican Party's first presidential bid in 1856, [this broadside](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:xg94j1990) provides a commentary on the geographical sectionalism that was polarizing the nation. Using 1850 census data, it tabulated the demographic and economic differences between free and slave states, highlighting political concerns that the balance of Congressional power would shift as newly acquired western territories were admitted as states into the Union. The map clearly marked the 1820 Missouri Compromise line, which had defined the boundary between free and slave states. However, the passage of the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act nullified this long-standing compromise line, and potentially opened the entire western territory to slavery because it sanctioned “popular sovereignty“ whereby citizens of each territory could vote on the slavery issue.

#### Edward S. Hall, [War maps and diagrams](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463305r) (1861)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f4633061/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Throughout their travels towards the Ohio River, James and Huckleberry Finn are subject to the twists and turns of the Mississippi. Towards the end of the novel, word of war breaking out reaches them and Huck wonders what side he would be on. Everett complicates “sides” throughout the novel. What side of the river or the street is safe? What side of a war is “better”?

#### Nancy Morita, ***[The ecology and natural history of San Francisco wild in the city](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C9000010)*** (1992)

{{< figure src="https://planetdrum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_wild_in_city.jpg" class="" >}}

[This poster-style map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C9000010) compares a view of the natural geography of San Francisco before colonization (1750) with a then present-day (1990s) street map to show what features could be restored to their natural state. The natural side of the map shows the location of the sand dunes, grasslands, wildflower-butterfly hilltops, Ohlone village sites, creek paths, salt marshes, and berry-brushlands that “underlie” the city of San Francisco. 

This map was created, in part, to reintroduce the natural landscape to San Franciscans and help them understand how it continued to influence their lives in the urbanized city 200+ years later. One example is to help explain why some people’s basements flood or buildings sink. This map was also attempting to help city dwellers connect more with urban wildlife and strengthen their connection with local wild areas’ restoration efforts.

#### General Drafting Company, ***[America's products and the trucks that carry them](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8919287)*** (1958)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Screenshot 2025-01-10 105012.png" >}}

This is [a 1958 General Drafting Company pictorial map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8919287) of the United States, its industry, and the transportation network used to move its products. The map follows the 1956 Federal-Aid Highway Act, celebrating the success of the American Highway system and the hard work of truckers in moving goods along a growing network of interstate trade. 

Pictorial vignettes highlight American production, from agricultural goods to aircraft parts and automobiles. Corn, potatoes, walnuts, citrus fruit, and flour appear among the nation's agricultural products. Coal, lead, uranium ore, copper, aluminum, and phosphates are named among the nation's mineral resources. Farm machinery, shoes, synthetic rubber, textiles, and paper represent a handful of manufactured products. America's highway network, illustrated below the green vignettes in shades of gray, serves as a network of commerce. The trucks that create the map's border carry it all, with many still in use today. Many of these were designed with specific purposes in mind: logging, beverage panel trucks, telephone line trucks, bulk milk trucks, ice cream trucks, and vehicle carriers, etc.

#### Walker Lith., ***[Canobie Lake Park, Salem N.H.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633j682j)*** (1912)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:5d86s675x/full/1450,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Canobie Lake Park is a staple of New England summers. Now known for their roller coasters and Taylor Swift impersonator, the park was originally a “trolley park” located at the end of the Massachusetts Northeast Street Railway Company and was designed to encourage trolley use on the weekends. To that end, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633j682j) was initially designed as a foldable brochure. At the time of this map’s creation in 1912, Canobie Lake Park consisted of flower gardens, walking paths, and “gentle attractions” like a swimming pool.

#### ***[Panoramic view of Boston centered on the Prudential Tower](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:h128th21w)*** (1968)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:rj4356675/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:h128th21w) from 1968 shows a bird’s eye view of what the Prudential Tower and its surroundings looked like when it was first completed—spot the separate buildings that make up the tower in the middle (the compass rose marks the top of the tower).

When first built in the early 1960s, the shopping centre we know now was a part of a huge redevelopment wave in Boston (think Boston City Hall, Government Center, etc). It was originally a series of separated buildings with the main “Prudential Tower” as the centerpiece. Over the years, the buildings were connected, bridged, and developed into “the Pru” we know today that welcomes more than 60,000 visitors a day.
