> *On May 2, we hosted **From The Vault — A Legacy of Leadership and Resilience: AANHPI History Month.***

###### As Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month begins, this From The Vault examines the ways maps can support and inform Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander history across the globe and what it means for a map to be truly representative of a place and its people.

#### Charles H. Ourand, [Map of Hawaii](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cr56r708p) (1901)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:sf26cb87j/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This 1901 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cr56r708p) of Hawaii was completed by the US government three years after the former independent nation had been forcibly annexed to the United States, following the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. Up until this point, Hawaii had always been an independent nation and was recognized as such by all other nations around the world. Reasons cited for this takeover include the expansion of U.S.-owned sugar cane plantations, military interests, and the desire to expand American influence to other nations. Though they faced numerous and harsh pushback from the US government, present-day Hawaiians have maintained many core aspects of their culture (language, dance, culture, community) and many still believe in a independent Hawaiian nation.

#### Miguel Covarrubias, [Peoples of the Pacific](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n348w) (1940)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:q524n660s/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Representing one map in a set of six, this 1940 pictorial map was intended to represent the “peoples of the pacific” and includes many communities and countries that border the Pacific ocean. This group of six maps were created for the Golden Gate International Exposition: A Pageant of the Pacific, what was essentially a World’s Fair hosted in San Francisco from 1939-1940 with a heavy focus on the Pacific and the future. This theme was observed through displays of new science, technology, the arts and entertainment.

Though [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n348w) aimed to be representative of different cultures across the Pacific, attempts at representation from people with little knowledge or background on the cultures they're trying to capture may show stereotypical, demeaning, or inaccurate depictions of people and places. 

#### Takai Ranzan, [Ansei kaisei Oedo ōezu = Map of Jeddo](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht250b870) (1849)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:ht250b888/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[A hand-colored map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht250b870) of Jeddo (Edo), or Tokyo, Japan, we are shown the Shogunate precinct and gardens, government offices, houses and grounds, temples, shrines, bays, rivers, markets, canals, roads, bridges, and fields of rice and vegetables. This map is all the work of native artists, and was printed and colored in the City of Jeddo, Japan for the Rev. Henry Wood.

Jeddo, Yedo, or Yeddo are anglicizations referring to the town and port of Edo, Japan and the adjacent large bay, and generally to the ruling shogunate of Japan during the 1850s and 1860s, which was based in Edo. After the Meiji Restoration (beginning in 1868 and began the “modernization” of Japan), the imperial capital was moved from Kyoto to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo which means “Eastern Capital.”

#### Matthew Fontaine Maury, ***[Whale Chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f952x)*** (1851)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633f9536/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

The importance of the mid-19th-century American whaling industry, which was dominated by ports in southern New England, especially New Bedford, Massachusetts, is documented by this innovative thematic map. It was prepared by Matthew Fontaine Maury, an American naval officer and oceanographer who served as the Superintendent of the U.S. Navy Depot of Charts and Instruments (later the U.S. Naval Observatory) from 1842 to 1861. Because of his contributions to oceanography including a series of wind and current charts for the world oceans, Maury is often recognized as the father of the science of oceanography. 

By centering [the map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f952x) on the Pacific Ocean, however, Maury showed that the primary habitat of whales was the Pacific arena rather than the Atlantic, where the whale resources had been terribly depleted. Interestingly, the sperm whale distribution was heavily concentrated in the central Pacific. This includes the area between Hawaii and the California coast, appearing just to the right of the map's center, where New England whalers focused their efforts. Seasonal variations were indicated by the letters w (winter), v (spring), s (summer), a (autumn), and all (all months).

#### H.H. Lloyd, ***[Telegraph chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149w21m)*** (1858)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149w22w/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149w21m) shows the track of the great submarine Atlantic telegraph in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Europe, and north Africa, as well as submarine cables, steamship routes, and proposed lines to be added at a later date. Included to accompany the chart are two double column articles of text: one accounts the invention and operation of the magnetic telegraph and the other is a description of the making and laying submarine telegraph cables. The laying of the Atlantic cable was one of the great international undertakings of the nineteenth century and would take the equivalent of billions of dollars, four failed attempts, and another 8 years after this map was published before it was completed.

#### Jean-Baptiste-Paul Touquet, ***[Chart shewing the tracks across the North Atlantic Ocean of Don Christopher Columbus](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6t053s69r)*** (1828)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:6t053s70h/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Sailing under the Spanish flag, Christopher Columbus voyaged from Europe across the North Atlantic to the West Indies and made four separate voyages departing from either Spain or Portugal. From his first voyage in 1492-93 to his final voyage in 1502-04, he visited many Caribbean islands, including the larger ones of Hispaniola, Cuba, and Jamaica, as well as the northern coast of South America. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6t053s69r), published in Paris in 1828, reconstructs the approximate routes of Columbus' trans-Atlantic passages, indicating his location by month and day. The patterns established in these early voyages, which used the predominant ocean currents and the Trade Winds, are the general routes followed by many from the Iberian peninsula and Africa's West Coast to the Caribbean.

#### Louis Désiré Léon Brault, Eduard Dumas-Vorzet, and C. Legros, ***[Océan Pacifique](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:zc77zv05s)*** (1880)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:np198971k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This sheet](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:zc77zv05s) is from a set of 4 charts showing direction and strength of winds at different times of year. Each square represents 10 degrees latitude and longitude, and the wind-roses (vector diagrams) show the direction and strength of prevailing winds. The length and color of each point indicate the intensity and likelihood of the winds and the direction it points corresponds with the wind's positionality. For example, a dark red line with a bit of yellow at the end pointing to the SW would mean this area most often has strong winds (dark red) — or the occasional gentle breeze (yellow) — blowing towards the southwest. The small number inside the circle of each diagram states the number of recordings taken from that location.
