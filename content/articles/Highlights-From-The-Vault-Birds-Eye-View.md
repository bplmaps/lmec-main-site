> On March 15, we hosted From The Vault: Bird's Eye View! From The Vault is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. Panoramic maps, also known as bird’s eye view maps, were a popular cartographic form used primarily by U.S. cities and towns during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Although not generally drawn to scale like a more “traditional” map, they show street patterns, individual buildings, and major landscape features from a raised perspective - resembling what a bird might see if it was flying over the area.

##### John Bachmann, [Bird's eye view of Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9g54xk528) (1850)

Offering a unique perspective of Boston, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9g54xk528) was created during the very beginnings of the panoramic map “trend”. This map depicts Boston as it was still in the process of backfilling land - the open water at the bottom of the map, oriented to the south of the Public gardens, is now the site of Back Bay, Newbury Street, and the Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library!

##### Boston and Maine Railroad, Passenger Department, [Bird’s Eye View from the Summit of Mt. Washington, New Hampshire](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3763140) (1902)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:wd3763158/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Although entitled a bird’s-eye view, this colorful presentation provides a fish-eye or 360-degree panoramic perspective. It distorts the topography of Mount Washington from a single vantage point directly above the mountain. The mountain’s summit, with accurately delineated buildings and the approaching road and railroad, is the central focus. Everything else is distorted. The surrounding mountains appear in the distance as non-distinctive colored hills, but each is numbered and identified in corresponding lists in the map’s four corners. Published by the Boston and Maine Railroad, [this artistic piece](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3763140) would certainly appeal to tourists visiting New England’s tallest landmark.

##### National Geographic Society, [Bird's-eye view of the Panama Canal](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s1619499) (1912)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s1619502/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Depicting a spectacular view of the Panama Canal, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s1619499) would have been of very high interest at the time. Created by National Geographic in 1912, the Panama Canal was not yet completed (construction finished in 1914). At this point in time, the only other route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans was to sail around South America or use the Panama Railroad to transfer goods and people from one ocean to another. Both of these options were incredibly time consuming, if not outright treacherous, and many people were eager to see any progress being made on the canal. 

##### Elizabeth Shurtleff and Helen F. McMillin, [A Map of the Bermuda Islands](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463854q) (1930)

Women were very active in the production of pictorial maps in the early 20th century. These whimsical maps frequently focused on travel and tourism. Bordered by a ribbon of ocean creatures, [this 1930 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463854q) of Bermuda illustrates various methods of transportation from horse-drawn carriages to pirate ships and airplanes. On shore, tourism reigns with beaches, golf courses, tennis courts, shooting ranges and historic forts. Designed by Elizabeth Shurtleff and Helen McMillin, who studied at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts and Wellesley College respectively, this map encourages visits to the island by promoting recreation and history.

##### Marie Tharp and Bruce Heezen, [Physiographic Diagram of the Western Pacific Ocean](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4730543) (1971)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Untitled (30).png" >}}

Oceanographic cartographer and geologist Marie Tharp, along with her research partner Bruce Heezen, created [the first map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4730543) of the entire ocean floor. Heezen was credited solely for their work for years, and only later on did Tharp gain her rightful place in the cartographic world (though Tharp credited as a contributor in the BPL catalog). Early editions of ocean floor mapping feature an informal sketch style, while later final editions were sophisticated physical maps with color and shading, applied to reveal the dramatic mid-ocean canyons highlighting the continental divisions of the globe. Numbers on the map indicate depth of the ocean floor and elevations of individual undersea mountains.

##### Valerie S. Goodwin, [City Grid IV](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C5709931) (2007, Reproduction, 2015)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Untitled (31).png" class="" >}}

As an architect and artist, Valerie Goodwin creates quilts inspired by building and urban design, and maps of real and imaginary places. She has used maps since her youth, and remembers that as a child she was fond of them and their visual representations. Goodwin uses color dramatically in her work, and emphasizes line and density by layering fabric. [City Grid IV](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C5709931) is an art quilt that focuses on the organization of an imaginary place. Goodwin experiments with two points of view in this quilt – one from above, and another from the side.

##### Linda Loubert, PhD; Morgan State University, [Making History – GIS and Women](https://arcg.is/1Cj1zj) (2014) 

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Untitled (32).png" >}}

In her work as professor of economics at Morgan State University, Linda Loubert teaches GIS to her students, using the technology in her classroom and in most of her research projects. In 2014 Dr. Loubert built a [crowdsourced web map](https://arcg.is/1Cj1zj) to “recognize women for the role they play in GIS.” This digital project asked women to contribute their professional affiliation and location to the web map, in an effort to visually document 10,000 women currently working in the GIS field around the globe. Female GIS professionals can still contribute to the online map.
