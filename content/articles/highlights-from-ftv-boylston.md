> On October 27, we hosted [From The Vault: Past and Future of Boylston Street](/event/ftv-bolyston-street/), together with our colleagues from the [Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics](https://www.boston.gov/departments/new-urban-mechanics) and the [Boston Transportation Department](https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation). In this edition of From the Vault, we focused on a street that's near and dear to us at the Boston Public Library: Boylston Street, which is about to be redesigned in order to support multimodal transportation priorities. Boylston Street has changed considerably over time, and this event was an opportunity to look at how the past might inform the present and future of this important urban corridor.

#### Before Boylston

These three maps all show the location of today's Boylston Street before the modern street was laid out. On each map, the pink outline indicates the later location of Boylston Street from Arlington Street to Massachusetts Avenue.

The entire stretch of Boylston Street lies on former salt marshes. During the 1913 Boylston Street subway extension project, workers discovered evidence of fish weirs constructed and maintained 5,200-3,700 YBP (Years Before Present). Indigenous peoples built these wooden traps on the mudflats for harvesting herring between high and low tide, when herring would swim to deeper waters and get caught in the weir in transit.

This [1852 plan represents an early design for the neighborhood](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cf95jd161) that would become the Back Bay, laid out on newly filled land. An ornamental lake would have formed the focal point of the neighborhood. While this plan was ultimately discarded, the idea of gridded streets that would serve in part as recreational amenities and promenades did become a key element of Back Bay’s urban landscape.

This [1860 plan shows Boylston Street about half completed](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1257bb23r), from Arlington to Exeter Street. The dotted outline of the tidal creek that still wound through Back Bay is visible just at the edge of the fill project, to the west and south of the Boylston-Exeter intersection.


#### Fuller & Whitney Co., Schedules of land sales, 1881-1882

Back Bay was Boston’s largest single project of land reclamation and real estate speculation. Hundreds of new parcels of property were created on former tidal lands and then sold, and these blueprints document that process. Many élite institutions, such as New Old South Church and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, located themselves along Boylston Street. In 1895, the Boston Public Library opened the building you are standing in right now, at 700 Boylston Street.
