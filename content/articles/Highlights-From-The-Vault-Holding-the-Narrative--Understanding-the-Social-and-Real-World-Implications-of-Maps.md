> *On February 21, we hosted **From The Vault: Holding the Narrative — Understanding the Social and Real World Implications of Maps.***

Sometimes, what’s not included can be just as informative as what’s being represented.

Maps and atlases hold the power of expressing (or not expressing) certain perspectives, or narratives, about a location that can become widely shared and considered absolute truth. In the case of the continent of Africa, and the consequences of the colonialism and imperialism it was subject to, these narratives have the potential to be unreliable, incomplete, or outright racist.

While looking through the maps and captions of Holding the Narrative: Understanding the Social and Real World Implications of Maps, consider what narratives you know about the continent and invite yourself to question what’s being shown in each map—from its physical features down to the historical context behind their creation.

#### Guillaume de L'Isle, [Carte de la Barbarie le la Nigritie et de la Guinée](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3765401) (1707)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:wd3765419/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3765401) shows the parts of northwestern Africa that makes up parts of modern day Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, the Central African Republic and Chad form the green region entitled “Nigritie” in the mapped subsection of northwestern Africa. “Nigritie” was a derogatory term coined by Europeans to describe this specific African region before the time of widespread European colonization. It had multiple variations across Europe, including “Negroland”, which was the term used amongst English speakers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

In fact, many of the modern names of African countries came from either the language spoken by European traders (Greek, Latin, Arabic, or Portuguese most often), European mispronunciations of place names given by the indigenous people of the region, or geographical features. Names hold the power to make places real, which is why many Africans choose to either refer to themselves by ethnic group or, more generally, as pan-African.

#### Johnston, Harry H. & J. G. Bartholomew, [Colonizability of Africa](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:31923299) (1899)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/PJM_2507_01.jpg" class="" >}}

This map is a part of a 300-page work by Sir Harry H. Johnston entitled “A History of the Colonization of Africa by Alien Races” (1899) that categorizes parts of Africa using the code word "health" to describe what type of colonialism would work best in a given area. Racist language throughout Johnston's explanatory note portrays Africa as a place seemingly "owed" to Britain, even to the extent of forced labor and expected obedience. 

Settler colonialism is alluded to by the "Healthy colonizable Africa" and "Fairly healthy Africa" categories, with the "Unhealthy but exploitable Africa" category describing extractive colonialism, where the indigenous population was to be kidnapped and enslaved.

As a longtime British colonial administrator in the late 19th century, Johnston would have been seen as an authority figure on knowledge about the African continent for those in the United Kingdom, thus he held power in shaping the way people thought of the continent. If you’re interested in learning more about Johnston and [this map](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:31923299) in relation to establishing power in empires, check out our past exhibition [Bending Lines](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/) on our website under "past exhibitions". 

#### Fuller & Whitney, c.e., ***[Plan of region west of Back Bay Park, Boston, Mass. : proposed improvements](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:t722mh264)*** (1886)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:ks65mk135/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This 1886 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:t722mh264) with overlays of what is now known as the Fenway neighborhood of Boston shows an array of possible configurations for a new neighborhood that would be created entirely anew at the tail-end of the decades-long project of filling in Boston’s Back Bay. Would the streets along Frederick Law Olmsted’s Muddy River Park (then still in progress) be gridded and regular, or would they be sinuous and curving, like the river itself? 

#### Lucy Durfee, ***[New England](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:2801vh693)*** (1834)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633m419q/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

During the late 18th and early 19th century, it was common practice for American female students attending private academies to prepare maps of various parts of the world by copying maps from books or atlases. Most often, girls were taught by female instructors, who drew maps themselves to demonstrate geographic, artistic and design skills to their pupils. Potentially based on Jesse Olney's 1829 Map of the eastern states, it’s thought that the cartographer is possibly Lucy Durfee (Borden) of Rhode Island, 1821-1890, daughter of politician and jurist Job Durfee.

#### Augustus Kollner & Morris H. Traubel, ***[The Hymenial Expositor, or, Matrimonial Chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n427b)*** (1849)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:q524n428m/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" >}}

This rather cynical bird’s-eye view map portraying the trials and tribulations of love and romance, as imagined in the context of mid-19th century life, is a cathartic break for some viewers who find themselves unsatisfied by what they perceive as ‘biased and sappy’ portrayals of love. With an image of a traditional marriage ceremony underneath the title, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n427b) rather surprisingly does not shy away from showing some of the stark realities that come with partnership and the many directions it can go. This can be seen quite clearly by the compass rose in the lower-left corner depicting the cardinal directions as "Hope", "Love", "Despair", and "Hatred".

#### J. R. Chapin, ***[A bird's-eye view of Providence : showing the new railroad station and State House](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fn39p)*** (1895)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:4m90fn40f/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

From the heights of College Hill, where Brown University and RISD stand tall, Providence, Rhode Island unfolds like a maze of streets and buildings, once a thriving industrial city. [This bird's-eye view](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fn39p) captures my city in a way that is both familiar and disorienting—especially for someone who spent years walking its hills. 

#### Walter Vrooman, ***[Map of New York City showing concrete socialism in red, and private enterprises in white, 1895](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c281)*** (1895)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fn107c299/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c281) uses a clever technique to argue that New York City was already a mostly socialist community by the end of the 19th century. It uses just two colors: red, the printing color, and the negative white space of the paper color. The red area shows the parts of the city that were putatively “socialist” already—things like roads, parks, bridges, and wharves that were owned and managed by the public. Only the leftover space was devoted to private enterprises. If the government could already handle so much of the infrastructure that made city life possible, this map seems to argue, its role could be expanded into a full socialist control of the economy.

#### John Kirtland Wright, ***[Panorama from the Pinnacle ("Acorn Hill," 1371'), Lyme, N.H.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:00002h22g)*** (1966)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:zw131n81k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This series of panoramic views draws us into the personal connections between geographers and the places they love. John Kirtland Wright (1891–1969) was an important academic geographer and for many years served as the librarian of the American Geographical Society. He retired to New Hampshire and in 1966, he sketched [this panoramic view](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:00002h22g) of “The Pinnacle,” a small rocky rise also known as Acorn Hill. Though at first these sketches might seem like a straightforward reference guide to the regional landscape, the full set of sheets draw the reader into stories of natural and human history that together make up a fully “place-based” study that is a hallmark of geography’s interdisciplinary tendencies. 

#### National Geographic Society (U.S.), ***[Earth at Night](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C2785584)*** (2004)

{{< figure src="https://images.natgeomaps.com/PROD_LG_1000px/HM20041102_1_LG.jpg" class="" >}}

This map was created by combining satellite imagery from cloud-free nights, taken by three satellites over a one-year period. In addition to the human infrastructure typically shown on these types of maps, [this map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C2785584) also shows fires (yellow), natural gas burn-off (red), and night fishing (blue).
