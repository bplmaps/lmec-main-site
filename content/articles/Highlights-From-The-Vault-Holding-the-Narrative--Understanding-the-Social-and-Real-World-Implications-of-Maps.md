> *On February 21, we hosted **From The Vault: Holding the Narrative — Understanding the Social and Real World Implications of Maps.***

Sometimes, what’s not included can be just as informative as what’s being represented.

Maps and atlases hold the power of expressing (or not expressing) certain perspectives, or narratives, about a location that can become widely shared and considered absolute truth. In the case of the continent of Africa, and the consequences of the colonialism and imperialism it was subject to, these narratives have the potential to be unreliable, incomplete, or outright racist.

While looking through the maps and captions of Holding the Narrative: Understanding the Social and Real World Implications of Maps, consider what narratives you know about the continent and invite yourself to question what’s being shown in each map—from its physical features down to the historical context behind their creation.

#### Guillaume de L'Isle, [Carte de la Barbarie le la Nigritie et de la Guinée](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3765401) (1707)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:wd3765419/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3765401) shows the parts of northwestern Africa that makes up parts of modern day Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, the Central African Republic and Chad form the green region entitled “Nigritie” in the mapped subsection of northwestern Africa. “Nigritie” was a derogatory term coined by Europeans to describe this specific African region before the time of widespread European colonization. It had multiple variations across Europe, including “Negroland”, which was the term used amongst English speakers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

In fact, many of the modern names of African countries came from either the language spoken by European traders (Greek, Latin, Arabic, or Portuguese most often), European mispronunciations of place names given by the indigenous people of the region, or geographical features. Names hold the power to make places real, which is why many Africans choose to either refer to themselves by ethnic group or, more generally, as pan-African.

#### Johnston, Harry H. & J. G. Bartholomew, [Colonizability of Africa](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:31923299) (1899)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/PJM_2507_01.jpg" class="" >}}

This map is a part of a 300-page work by Sir Harry H. Johnston entitled “A History of the Colonization of Africa by Alien Races” (1899) that categorizes parts of Africa using the code word "health" to describe what type of colonialism would work best in a given area. Racist language throughout Johnston's explanatory note portrays Africa as a place seemingly "owed" to Britain, even to the extent of forced labor and expected obedience. 

Settler colonialism is alluded to by the "Healthy colonizable Africa" and "Fairly healthy Africa" categories, with the "Unhealthy but exploitable Africa" category describing extractive colonialism, where the indigenous population was to be kidnapped and enslaved.

As a longtime British colonial administrator in the late 19th century, Johnston would have been seen as an authority figure on knowledge about the African continent for those in the United Kingdom, thus he held power in shaping the way people thought of the continent. If you’re interested in learning more about Johnston and [this map](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:31923299) in relation to establishing power in empires, check out our past exhibition [Bending Lines](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/) on our website under "past exhibitions". 

#### United States. Central Intelligence Agency, [Africa, ethnolinguistic groups](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n623n) (1996)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:q524n624x/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}


The fifteen major ethnolinguistic groups shown in [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n623n) are each represented by a colored region that encompasses the tribes or ethnic groups within it. The spread of ethnolinguistic groups across Africa are not confined by the boundaries of modern countries, and can overlap, as is the case of northwestern Nigeria. In the same vein, many countries have as many as 4 ethnolinguistic groups within their borders. So, if the borders of countries do not exist to encompass ethnolinguistic groups, then why do they exist the way that they do?

European powers were in danger of infighting in the late 1800s due to the speed at which each country was expanding their imperialist agenda to Africa. The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 met to solve this very issue by drawing borders and parceling off each of the newly formed 50 European colonies to each other. Since then, the number of countries and borders have changed due to newly independent sovereignties being established spanning from the 1920s to the 2010s.

#### Ernst Georg Ravenstein, [The graphic map of European possessions in Africa](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633fb524) (1884)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633fb53d/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

At the time of [this map’s](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633fb524) conception, the European countries listed on the map had claimed 10% of the African continent and its islands. Notably, their only claims at this point had been land along the coastline, islands, or rivers, as all were easily accessible by sea compared to the terrain more in-land on the continent. Land south of the Sahara desert was relatively unknown to European voyagers. The threat of malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans had no defenses for also made it difficult for them to invade civilizations that lay further in-land.  

#### William R. Shepherd, [The partition of Africa](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4637359#image) (1911)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463736k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

In the twenty-seven years after the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, colonization of the African continent developed rapidly past the initial establishment of colonial claims due to the final conference negotiations, which had allowed European countries to pick apart the continent as fast as they could. By 1914, a mere three years after [this map’s](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4637359#image) creation, 90% of the African continent was under some measure of European control—either for extractive purposes or establishing settler colonies.

At the same time, World War I was beginning, and many of these colonies, as extensions of the occupying European countries, sent their indigenous inhabitants to fight on behalf of these colonist empires.

#### J. R. Chapin, ***[A bird's-eye view of Providence : showing the new railroad station and State House](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fn39p)*** (1895)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:4m90fn40f/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

From the heights of College Hill, where Brown University and RISD stand tall, Providence, Rhode Island unfolds like a maze of streets and buildings, once a thriving industrial city. [This bird's-eye view](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fn39p) captures my city in a way that is both familiar and disorienting—especially for someone who spent years walking its hills. 

#### Walter Vrooman, ***[Map of New York City showing concrete socialism in red, and private enterprises in white, 1895](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c281)*** (1895)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fn107c299/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c281) uses a clever technique to argue that New York City was already a mostly socialist community by the end of the 19th century. It uses just two colors: red, the printing color, and the negative white space of the paper color. The red area shows the parts of the city that were putatively “socialist” already—things like roads, parks, bridges, and wharves that were owned and managed by the public. Only the leftover space was devoted to private enterprises. If the government could already handle so much of the infrastructure that made city life possible, this map seems to argue, its role could be expanded into a full socialist control of the economy.

#### John Kirtland Wright, ***[Panorama from the Pinnacle ("Acorn Hill," 1371'), Lyme, N.H.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:00002h22g)*** (1966)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:zw131n81k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This series of panoramic views draws us into the personal connections between geographers and the places they love. John Kirtland Wright (1891–1969) was an important academic geographer and for many years served as the librarian of the American Geographical Society. He retired to New Hampshire and in 1966, he sketched [this panoramic view](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:00002h22g) of “The Pinnacle,” a small rocky rise also known as Acorn Hill. Though at first these sketches might seem like a straightforward reference guide to the regional landscape, the full set of sheets draw the reader into stories of natural and human history that together make up a fully “place-based” study that is a hallmark of geography’s interdisciplinary tendencies. 

#### National Geographic Society (U.S.), ***[Earth at Night](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C2785584)*** (2004)

{{< figure src="https://images.natgeomaps.com/PROD_LG_1000px/HM20041102_1_LG.jpg" class="" >}}

This map was created by combining satellite imagery from cloud-free nights, taken by three satellites over a one-year period. In addition to the human infrastructure typically shown on these types of maps, [this map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C2785584) also shows fires (yellow), natural gas burn-off (red), and night fishing (blue).
