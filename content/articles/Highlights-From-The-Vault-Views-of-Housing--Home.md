> \*\*On June 21, we hosted \*From The Vault: Views of Housing & Home. \*\*\*\
> \
> *From The Vault* is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Leventhal Center staff with this week's theme specially curated by our Assistant Curator of Digital & Participatory Geography, **Ian Spangler**! In this *From The Vault*, we asked what do “housing and home” mean to you? Whether they’re are viewed as economic commodities, cultural signifiers, or basic rights will differ drastically depending on whom you ask. When depicted in maps, these different perspectives can alter our perception of what housing and home mean. During the event, we explored these different perspectives and asked questions about why our understanding of home can look so different for so many people.

The National Association of Real Estate Boards (known today as the National Association of Realtors®) created this map in 1926 to promote the realtors’ 19th annual convention. In playful and sometimes shocking detail, it highlights the kinds of professional activities and behaviors that informed realtors’ cultural, economic, and professional identities at the time. In Miami, for example, we find L.W. Crow kicking the curbstone “binder boys” into the sea, while just north of Ontario, Goodwin Gibson professes his belief in “international multiple listing.” At the same time, the map showcases common prejudices held by the real estate industry, visible in the racist depiction of a Black man in Mississippi – a reminder of the historical exclusions and discriminatory practices that have haunted U.S. housing for hundreds of years.

##### **H. T. Whitman** *[Plan of Orient Heights, Boston, Mass ](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:js956m23t)*(1894)

With Boston’s rising population and increased demand for housing, the Boston Land Company began to develop former marshland in East Boston in the 1880s, including Hog Island (also called Breed’s Island) which became Orient Heights. This promotional map invites the viewer to imagine themselves in one such newly developed suburb. The invocation to “SECURE A HOME” and “STOP PAYING RENT” may seem like a simple advertisement, but it also serves as a precursor to the “Own Your Own Home” movement that would take off a couple of decades after this map was made. Homeownership would become associated with responsible citizenship, and so-called “transient” renters were considered unscrupulous.

A city’s shared history depends greatly upon its unique architectural styles. In the Greater Boston area, there is perhaps no style more quintessential than the so-called “triple-decker.” In the 1870s, these three-story buildings enjoyed a surge in popularity. By 1920, about 15,000 triple deckers had been constructed. Created by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) in the 1970s, these maps document the distribution of triple decker homes in the City of Boston.

This map, drawn by a schoolgirl in 1831, shows the non-existent Mountains of Kong in West Africa on the northern border of the “Coast of Guinea” and the equally fictitious Mountains of the Moon in East Africa on the northern border of Ethiopia. Ancient Greek and Roman geographers believed the Mountains of the Moon were the source of the White Nile River. The Mountains of Kong in West Africa were reported and drawn on maps by explorers in the 1800s. Both of these mountain ranges were common knowledge, appearing in encyclopedias and maps, and taught in schools until fading away in the late

##### Henri Abraham Chatelain *[Mappmonde ou description generale du globe terrestre](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161d837)* \[1705–1739]

From the 15th to 18th centuries, people believed that the land in the northern hemisphere was balanced by a large unknown landmass in the southern hemisphere, often referred to as Terra Australis Incognita (Latin for unknown southern land). As explorers charted the southern hemisphere, the hypothesized continent morphed from connecting to South America, Africa, and Australia to being a separate continent and eventually believed to either lie within the polar regions or to not exist at all.

##### **Gerhard Mercator** [*Septentrionalium terrarum descriptio* ](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:8049g9006)\[1595]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:8049g901g/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map shows Gerhard Mercator’s idea of the Arctic region, based on his research of explorer accounts and other maps. It shows a tall black rock in the middle of a whirlpool formed by four rivers between four countries. The water in the whirlpool descends into the Earth like a funnel. While the black rock marks true north, another rock above it is the magnetic one to which compasses point, explaining the difference between true north and magnetic north. The map includes notes about the inhabitants of the four countries and other places.

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:wd376231f/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map shows two geographical misconceptions about the Pacific coast of North America. The Sea of the West, shown on this map as the Great Lake of Thoago or Thoya, was a large inland sea that appeared on maps in the 17th and 18th centuries. Juan de Fuca claimed to have sailed up a strait (possibly the current Strait of Juan de Fuca between Vancouver Island and Washington state) to the sea in 1592. This map also shows California as an island, which was possibly assumed by early explorers and spread as cartographers copied each other’s maps. By the 1800s, coastal and overland expeditions debunked these errors.

##### **Willem Janszoon Blaeu** *[Asia noviter delineata](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:st74cw80x)* \[1650]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:st74cw816/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Early accounts by Portuguese explorers in the 1500s described Lake Chiamay as an enormous lake in southeast Asia that was the source of many rivers in Bangladesh, Burma, and Thailand. The lake appears on this map to the lower right of the center, below the illustration of an elephant. The name likely came from the city of Chiang Mai in northern Thailand. The lake was included in maps, encyclopedias, and gazetteers up to the mid-1700s.

Phantom islands are islands that were purportedly seen by sailors and explorers and even appeared on maps for a time before later being deemed nonexistent. One of the most famous phantom islands is Hy-Brasil located west of Ireland and shown in the lower left on this map. In Irish legend, the island is constantly shrouded in mist and appears once every seven years. Some mariners claimed to have discovered the legendary island and reported fantastic accounts of otherworldly beings.
