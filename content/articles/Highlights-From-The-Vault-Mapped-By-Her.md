> *On March 7, we hosted **From The Vault: Mapped By Her -The Uncharted Influence of Women in Cartography***

##### Women have always been a part of charting the Earth throughout history.

Histories of map-making generally emphasize the role of men; however, since the advent of the printed map, women have worked as colorists, engravers, shop owners, publishers, and, most importantly, as map-makers themselves. 

This selection of maps was intended to help visitors encounter works by female map creators, designers and educators, learn about the various cartographic skills employed by women over the centuries, and observe the transition of women in cartography from marginalized to celebrated. 

#### Eliza Tileston, ***[Map of Massachusetts](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:mw22xn331)*** (1819)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3n206f808/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

During the late 18th and early 19th century, it was common practice for American female students attending private academies to prepare maps of various parts of the world by copying maps from books or atlases. Most often, girls were taught by female instructors, who drew maps themselves to demonstrate geographic, artistic and design skills to their pupils. [This map of Massachusetts](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:mw22xn331) was done using ink and watercolor by a schoolgirl, Eliza Tileston and was possibly gifted to a friend, as the message “To Clara” is written on verso in lower left.

#### Mary B. Hotz, [Historical map of Watertown, 1630-1930](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4638525) (1930)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463853f/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Mary Hotz designed this map as a high school student in 1930, for a poster contest celebrating the 300th anniversary of Watertown, Massachusetts. [Her map of historical Watertown](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4638525), complete with Native Americans, houses, churches, arsenals, courthouses, taverns, mills, schools and statues was the winning entry. Hotz combined recent and past history in this colorful and detailed map, which she shared with local community clubs, and President Calvin Coolidge, who had family ties to the town. She eventually attended art school in Boston, but never practiced professionally; however, her map appeared in official buildings and private residences throughout Watertown for years.

#### Agnes Sinclair Holbrook, [“Nationalities Map No. 1,” from Hull-House Maps and Papers …](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4636086) (1895)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463609g/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Designed by Agnes Sinclair Holbrook, a Wellesley College graduate and resident of Chicago’s Hull-House, this thematic map of the neighborhood east of the House illustrates the immigrant population living in the area. A female-based social settlement in Chicago’s Near West Side, Jane Addams founded the settlement house in 1889, offering newcomers childcare as well as classes in English and civics. Hull-House played an important role in social reforms of the late 19th-century, and its residents were responsible for transcribing, interpreting and mapping statistical data for the map displayed here. Part of a set of four, [the map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4636086) is heavily influenced by earlier statistical mapping by Charles Booth’s wage maps of London, first published in 1889. This statistical cartographic presentation foreshadows GIS mapping – using color and statistics to present social facts.

#### Mildred Giddings Burrage, [The attack on Bunker Hill in the peninsula of Charlestown the 17th of June 1775](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463832p) (1926)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463833z/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Maine-based artist Mildred Burrage created many paintings and drawings throughout her career, which began in the early 20th-century. Burrage studied art in both America and Europe, and created numerous impressionist works while staying in France. In the 1920s, she executed several relief-paintings based on historic maps, prints, engravings and photographs. The gesso relief painting displayed here is similar to a vignette illustrated in Sayer and Bennett’s 1775 map “The Seat of War in New England.” [Here](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463832p) Burrage has enlarged the battle scene, and used a gesso (white paint mixture) build-up to show relief. She added gold leaf to the piece for added decorative flare.

#### Augustus Kollner & Morris H. Traubel, ***[The Hymenial Expositor, or, Matrimonial Chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n427b)*** (1849)

This rather cynical bird’s-eye view map portraying the trials and tribulations of love and romance, as imagined in the context of mid-19th century life, is a cathartic break for some viewers who find themselves unsatisfied by what they perceive as ‘biased and sappy’ portrayals of love. With an image of a traditional marriage ceremony underneath the title, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n427b) rather surprisingly does not shy away from showing some of the stark realities that come with partnership and the many directions it can go. This can be seen quite clearly by the compass rose in the lower-left corner depicting the cardinal directions as "Hope", "Love", "Despair", and "Hatred".

> “I like this map because it isn’t entirely pessimistic, as the “Bay of Delight”, “River Amour”, and “Fort of Felicity” icons in the upper-right corner show the joys possible in "The Great Ocean of Love". The iconography across the map is a fascinating blend of tragedy, joy, and humor, with personal favorites being the "Gulf of Self Love" in the upper-left corner and the "Sands of Inconstancy" in the lower-left corner.”

#### J. R. Chapin, ***[A bird's-eye view of Providence : showing the new railroad station and State House](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fn39p)*** (1895)

*Selected by Kiana Harriel, Experiential Learning & Programs Educator*

From the heights of College Hill, where Brown University and RISD stand tall, Providence, Rhode Island unfolds like a maze of streets and buildings, once a thriving industrial city. [This bird's-eye view](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fn39p) captures my city in a way that is both familiar and disorienting—especially for someone who spent years walking its hills. 

> “I love this map because it shows a different version of Providence, one without places that are important to me today. It’s a reminder of how the city has grown and changed over time, but also how much of its physical structures remain the same.”

#### Walter Vrooman, ***[Map of New York City showing concrete socialism in red, and private enterprises in white, 1895](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c281)*** (1895)

*Selected by Ian Spangler, Assistant Curator for Digital and Participatory Geography*

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fn107c299/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c281) uses a clever technique to argue that New York City was already a mostly socialist community by the end of the 19th century. It uses just two colors: red, the printing color, and the negative white space of the paper color. The red area shows the parts of the city that were putatively “socialist” already—things like roads, parks, bridges, and wharves that were owned and managed by the public. Only the leftover space was devoted to private enterprises. If the government could already handle so much of the infrastructure that made city life possible, this map seems to argue, its role could be expanded into a full socialist control of the economy.

> “I love this map because it serves as a powerful reminder of where public goods are located in the world around us. Where do you see public, shared goods in your everyday life?”

#### John Kirtland Wright, ***[Panorama from the Pinnacle ("Acorn Hill," 1371'), Lyme, N.H.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:00002h22g)*** (1966)

*Selected by Garrett Dash Nelson, President and Head Curator*

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:zw131n81k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This series of panoramic views draws us into the personal connections between geographers and the places they love. John Kirtland Wright (1891–1969) was an important academic geographer and for many years served as the librarian of the American Geographical Society. He retired to New Hampshire and in 1966, he sketched [this panoramic view](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:00002h22g) of “The Pinnacle,” a small rocky rise also known as Acorn Hill. Though at first these sketches might seem like a straightforward reference guide to the regional landscape, the full set of sheets draw the reader into stories of natural and human history that together make up a fully “place-based” study that is a hallmark of geography’s interdisciplinary tendencies. 

> “I can't promise this is my absolute *favorite* map in the collections, but just one that might get overlooked and which tells an interesting story. It’s a document which bears not only the unmistakable imprint of Wright’s professional training as a geographer and cartographer, but also the personal or even spiritual connection the elderly Wright must have felt towards this place.”

#### National Geographic Society (U.S.), ***[Earth at Night](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C2785584)*** (2004)

*Selected by Lauren Chen, Reference and Cataloging Librarian*

{{< figure src="https://images.natgeomaps.com/PROD_LG_1000px/HM20041102_1_LG.jpg" class="" >}}

This map was created by combining satellite imagery from cloud-free nights, taken by three satellites over a one-year period. In addition to the human infrastructure typically shown on these types of maps, [this map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C2785584) also shows fires (yellow), natural gas burn-off (red), and night fishing (blue).

> “I like this map because it has a lot of visual appeal and, unlike other maps depicting the world at night, this one clearly shows the lights of seafaring ships and vessels.”
