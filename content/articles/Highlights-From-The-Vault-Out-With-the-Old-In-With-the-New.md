> *On October 25, we hosted **From The Vault: Out With the Old, In With the New***.

As the technology that we use improves and advances, so too do the things we can create with that technology. Maps in the modern day look drastically different than those used several hundred years ago, and are now able to tell us a multitude of different things than they could previously. But what do these changes actually look like? How has the process of digitizing cartography evolved how we communicate our place in the world? And how do maps from hundreds of years ago compare to the maps we use to navigate our world today? Look through the maps and caption from *Out With the Old, In With the New* for answers to these questions.

##### Ptolemy,  ***[The world](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:hq37vv66t)*** (1482)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:hq37vv673/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

“The World” is a map from the late 1400s that served as part of a 2nd century printed Atlas based on geographical knowledge of the Roman Empire entitled “Cosmographia”. This map of the world in particular was originally created by Greek-Egyptian geographer Claudius Ptolemy, then lost to time and only later recreated using coordinates left in surviving texts. Often thought of as the father of cartography, Ptolemy’s maps were integral to how location and place were thought about throughout medieval Europe, and had long lasting impacts on how we think of geography today. By building on some of the first known attempts at projection in mapping (the method by which cartographers mathematically represent the Earth’s spherical surface on a flat plane), Ptolemy’s world map was considered mostly accurate and used for years before any changes were made. Because the “New World” had yet to be discovered, the center of this map highlights the meeting point between Asia, Europe, and Africa. 

##### United States. Central Intelligence Agency, [Physical map of the world, April 2001](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3t947c03j) (2001)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:js956j046/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This “Physical Map of the World” from 2001 used by the CIA shows a modern view of the world in the 21st century and features light topography to demonstrate the different elevations and terrains of each continent. Similarly to Ptolemy’s world map, this map also employs projection, though it uses a more modern method of cylindrical projection called “Robinson projection.” Robinson projection was developed by Arthur H. Robinson in 1963 using computer simulation to create a more visually pleasing and overall more accurate looking world map. Instead of keeping the proportions as accurate as possible for most of the map and greatly distorting the poles like a usual Mercator projection, the Robinson projection causes slight distortions across the entirety of the image. While less useful for navigation than other projection techniques, the Robinson projection is commonly used on world maps to visually demonstrate general world proportions. 

##### Ptolemy, [Oceani occidetalis seu terre nove tabula](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:j3860837q) (1525)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:j38608380/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map of the Atlantic Ocean and New World from the mid 1520s is one of the first representations of the West Indies and South America on a map in recorded history, and surprisingly accurate given the recency of the land’s discovery. This map comes about 30 years after Columbus’ first voyage to the new world and features the Southeastern corner of what is now the United States including Florida. The Gulf of Mexico and the shape of Central America remain largely amorphous on this map, and the scale of South America and Spain in comparison to Africa is extremely overinflated. The humanoid illustrations on this map demonstrate colonists' initial crude impressions of the native peoples whose longstanding homes were part of what Europeans referred to as the “New World”. Unfortunately, these opinions would persist through the coming centuries and heavily shaped stereotypes and opinions around peoples of the New World, specifically South America, for centuries to come. 

##### Netherlands. Koninklijke Marine. Dienst der Hydrografie, [North Atlantic Ocean, West Indies](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463890k) (1993)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463c37p/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This 1993 map of the West Indies demonstrates a significantly more accurate scale than the map from the 1520s, and really spotlights the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the Northern part of the Atlantic Ocean. Upon first glance, this map may take some adjusting to as it is primarily mapping the ocean as opposed to landmasses. The yellow represents the Southeastern US and West Indies as well as Central and South America, and anything in blue or white represents different oceanic features. This specific map highlights the different depths of the ocean off the coasts of North and South America, and really shows off the proper scale of Cuba and the other Caribbean islands as compared to the map from the 1500s. As technology became more prevalent in the map making process, accuracy in size and scale became more assured. 

##### Ptolemy, [Indie interioris civitates decima Asia tabula continet India int. Gangem](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h14b129t) (1482)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:2v241v11d/full/,850/0/default.jpg" >}}

This map of Asia from 1482 is another Ptolemic map recreated from the writings of early Greco-Egyptian geographer Claudius Ptolemy. The map focuses primarily on India and faintly its surrounding area. What many older maps are choosing to show us versus what they omit frequently provides more information about the time period than strictly looking at the geography of the map itself. In this case, the map is putting so much focus into India because that is the main Asian country that the Roman Empire was trading with in the 1st century. While there was minimal established trade contact between the Roman Empire and other Asian countries to trade delicacies like silk and glassware, there was no direct trade route established to these places. India on the other hand had many direct trading routes with Europe during this time, so the area West of the Ganges river as seen here was mapped extensively.

##### &#xA;United States. Central Intelligence Agency, [Asia](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463913p) (2004)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463914z/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" caption="" >}}

This 2004 map of Asia created by the CIA shows off the geography and topography of both South and East Asia, and provides a comprehensive look at the different natural features of the land (mountains, rivers, deserts, etc.) as well as listing the locations of each country and their capital cities. Looking at this modernized computer generated map of India, one can see how dramatically different the scale of different areas of the country was depicted in Ptolemy’s time vs now. Despite both of these maps being fairly bare bones, a shift in tone from more decorative mapping to more practical mapping can be clearly seen between these two especially. This map features a miniature scale in the bottom left hand corner of the map meant to demonstrate the actual sizes of the landmarks portrayed, as opposed to a more decorative scale bordering the entirety of the map as seen on the 1482 model. Even features of maps so small and minute as a scale can affect the tone of the map and what we take away from it!

This graphic is a helpful visual to understand the different resolutions of aerial imagery and which scales are most useful for different planning and land use studies. It’s important to note that when this poster was produced, the standard form of imagery like this would have been aerial imagery that was produced through dozens of hours of plane flights across the state of Massachusetts. Today, this method of creating land use imagery is still used, but is now also augmented by the increasing availability of satellite imagery.

##### MassGIS ***[EOEA MassGIS geographic information system transition document](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:dn402997f)*** (1990)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:j6735c05m/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This document was produced by Applied Geographics, Inc. as a tool for MassGIS to be able to bridge a technology transition to primarily computer-led workflows for making maps across the agency. This document is a collection of visualizations of statewide datasets that can be used in different contexts and examples of maps made for different specific applications. Of particular interest are the descriptions and definitions listed above that give administrative context for why this document was created.
