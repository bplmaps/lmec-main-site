> *On October 25, we hosted **From The Vault: Out With the Old, In With the New***.

As the technology that we use improves and advances, so too do the things we can create with that technology. Maps in the modern day look drastically different than those used several hundred years ago, and are now able to tell us a multitude of different things than they could previously. But what do these changes actually look like? How has the process of digitizing cartography evolved how we communicate our place in the world? And how do maps from hundreds of years ago compare to the maps we use to navigate our world today? Look through the maps and caption from *Out With the Old, In With the New* for answers to these questions\*\*\*. \*\*\*

##### Ptolemy ***[The world](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:hq37vv66t)*** (1482)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:hq37vv673/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

“The World” is a map from the late 1400s that served as part of a 2nd century printed Atlas based on geographical knowledge of the Roman Empire entitled “Cosmographia”. This map of the world in particular was originally created by Greek-Egyptian geographer Claudius Ptolemy, then lost to time and only later recreated using coordinates left in surviving texts. Often thought of as the father of cartography, Ptolemy’s maps were integral to how location and place were thought about throughout medieval Europe, and had long lasting impacts on how we think of geography today. By building on some of the first known attempts at projection in mapping (the method by which cartographers mathematically represent the Earth’s spherical surface on a flat plane), Ptolemy’s world map was considered mostly accurate and used for years before any changes were made. Because the “New World” had yet to be discovered, the center of this map highlights the meeting point between Asia, Europe, and Africa. 

##### United States. Central Intelligence Agency [Physical map of the world, April 2001](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3t947c03j) (2001)

This “Physical Map of the World” from 2001 used by the CIA shows a modern view of the world in the 21st century and features light topography to demonstrate the different elevations and terrains of each continent. Similarly to Ptolemy’s world map, this map also employs projection, though it uses a more modern method of cylindrical projection called “Robinson projection.” Robinson projection was developed by Arthur H. Robinson in 1963 using computer simulation to create a more visually pleasing and overall more accurate looking world map. Instead of keeping the proportions as accurate as possible for most of the map and greatly distorting the poles like a usual Mercator projection, the Robinson projection causes slight distortions across the entirety of the image. While less useful for navigation than other projection techniques, the Robinson projection is commonly used on world maps to visually demonstrate general world proportions. 

##### Ptolemy Oceani occidetalis seu terre nove tabula (1525)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:j38608380/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map of the Atlantic Ocean and New World from the mid 1520s is one of the first representations of the West Indies and South America on a map in recorded history, and surprisingly accurate given the recency of the land’s discovery. This map comes about 30 years after Columbus’ first voyage to the new world and features the Southeastern corner of what is now the United States including Florida. The Gulf of Mexico and the shape of Central America remain largely amorphous on this map, and the scale of South America and Spain in comparison to Africa is extremely overinflated. The humanoid illustrations on this map demonstrate colonists' initial crude impressions of the native peoples whose longstanding homes were part of what Europeans referred to as the “New World”. Unfortunately, these opinions would persist through the coming centuries and heavily shaped stereotypes and opinions around peoples of the New World, specifically South America, for centuries to come. 

##### MassGIS ***[The Appalachian trail in Massachusetts](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rx918q84f)*** (1991)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:pc28gk205/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map is an incredibly sophisticated example of the complicated layouts and visualizations that could be achieved using the mapmaking softwares of the early 1990s. What is noteworthy from our perspective, however, is how the cartographer (noted as “MT” in the bottom left hand corner) left his humorous mark on the piece. “MT” is Mike Terner, a former employee of Applied Geographics, Inc., which was contracted by MassGIS to make maps throughout the 1990s and Mike left small linework visualizations of hikers scattered across the page — a creative way to add visual interest while working within the confines of printing technology at the time.

##### Geological Survey (U.S.). National Mapping Division ***[Index to 1:24,000-scale digital line graph (DLG) and digital elevation model (DEM) data](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7d27fs716)*** (1995)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:2v241v11d/full/,850/0/default.jpg" >}}

This map was created as a reference poster for folks working with federal spatial data and would have been useful to discover what kinds of datasets existed for places across the United States. In the map, the country has been divided into a large grid and each “cell” (or individual rectangle) of the grid has symbols that show what kinds of datasets were completed (red background with black symbols) or in progress (white background with green symbols) for each part of the country. Visualizations of digital elevation models can be seen in Views of Cape Ann and The Appalachian trail in Massachusetts.

##### MassGIS ***[GIS mapping of risk factors for eastern equine encephalitis](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rv047v771)*** (1991)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:5x220j19j/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="" >}}

This set of maps was created in 1991 as the State of Massachusetts faced increased risk of eastern equine encephalitis (Triple E virus) spreading, with each map showing a different variable for the same geographic extent. Public health applications are still one of the most common uses for making maps using computers. Earlier tin 2024, this same virus was making headlines for confirmed cases in the state!

##### MassGIS ***[Digital orthography checkplots](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rj435666w)*** (2000)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cv43tx62n/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This graphic is a helpful visual to understand the different resolutions of aerial imagery and which scales are most useful for different planning and land use studies. It’s important to note that when this poster was produced, the standard form of imagery like this would have been aerial imagery that was produced through dozens of hours of plane flights across the state of Massachusetts. Today, this method of creating land use imagery is still used, but is now also augmented by the increasing availability of satellite imagery.

##### MassGIS ***[EOEA MassGIS geographic information system transition document](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:dn402997f)*** (1990)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:j6735c05m/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This document was produced by Applied Geographics, Inc. as a tool for MassGIS to be able to bridge a technology transition to primarily computer-led workflows for making maps across the agency. This document is a collection of visualizations of statewide datasets that can be used in different contexts and examples of maps made for different specific applications. Of particular interest are the descriptions and definitions listed above that give administrative context for why this document was created.
