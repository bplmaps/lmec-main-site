> *On November 1, we hosted **From The Vault: Indigenous Geographies***.

Highlighting Indigenous geographies and guest curated by Amira Madison, the Supporting Indigenous Communities Fellow at the Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, we explored collections that document Native life and land in New England and beyond. Look through the maps and captions below from *Indigenous Geographies* to further many histories and perspectives explored in this selection of maps.

#### Gideon Hawley, [Plan of Mashpee](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kr37q) (1785)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82kr380/full/,1400/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Prior to being a town, Mashpee was first named an Indian Plantation. and this is one of the original drawn out plans. This is how the United States planned to manage Tribes west of the Mississippi, but first piloted the policy in Massachusetts. The Dawes Act, also known as the Dawes Severalty Act or General Allotment Act, was passed by Congress in 1887 to break up tribal lands and assimilate Native Americans into mainstream US society. The act was named after Senator Dawes from Massachusetts, who was the primary proponent of the legislation. 


#### Margaret W. Pearce, [Coming Home to Indigenous Place Names in Canada](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C7441004) (2017)

What does it look like for an Indigenous person to create a map from the Indigenous perspective with Indigenous collaboration? How can Indigenous languages explain the land more accurately than any typical map?

#### United States. Office of Indian Affairs, [Map showing Indian reservations within the limits of the United States, 1906](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:gb19hw10q) (1907)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:rb6912172/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Today, we have 574 Federally Recognized Tribes across the United States. In 1906, according to this map, there are only a few communities highlighted that are east of Mississippi. Why is that? Well, here in Massachusetts, treaties were initially created with the English, not the United States government. Over centuries, as the founding colonies expanded and the United States became a country, the old treaties were disregarded or blatantly ignored in favor of colonial expansion. 

#### Don Bloodgood, [Navajoland, U.S.A.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fb4970132) (1960)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fj238r160/full/,1400/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

There is something quirky and fun about this map design! The Navajo Nation is the largest reservation and has the biggest Tribal population in the United States. This was a map authorized by Navajo Nation’s Tribal Council as a part of a visitors guide brochure and includes everything from important natural sites like the sacred mountains to the areas where rug designs are created.

#### [Nathan Braccio](https://nathanbraccio.com/), Praying Towns Relative to English Borders, Algonquian Country, and Major Algonquian Path

{{< figure src="https://nathanbraccio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Full-map.png" >}}

“Praying Towns” were created in the 17th century to christianize and forcibly assimilate Native Americans in Massachusetts. As Puritan authority over the region grew, so did the number of praying towns. Additionally, these towns were deliberately placed along major Algonquian paths that were highly frequented by the Indigenous people of the area, almost guaranteeing interaction with the Puritans determined to convert them.

#### James Mooney, [Map showing distribution of indian stocks and tribes, between 1710-1720 ](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149w677)(1904)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149w68h/full/,1400/0/default.jpg" >}}

This 1904 map is depicting the perceived historic ancestry/Tribes of Indigenous people across the United States - think of how this map compares to some of the more modern, Indigenous-created maps also on display. Currently, all Federally Recognized Nations are managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which sits under the umbrella of the Department of Interior. The present Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, is the first American Indian to lead this department since its founding in 1849.

This 1608 map of Mexico was created by Flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius during a period of time in which Spain had control over both Belgium and Mexico. Because of this, this map is extremely decorative, and focuses on both the vastness of the land that Spain possessed in the area now known as Mexico as well as focusing primarily on Spanish landmarks and settlements in the country. Frequently, the royalty of powerful countries would have their royal geographers create maps of land they possessed not strictly to demonstrate the geography of the land but to overinflate the area they supposedly controlled to make them appear more powerful. In this case, Ortelius was drawing the land to such a grand scale to make it look larger and more impressive than it actually was so Spain could flex its imperial power. Ortelius also entirely ignored the Americas in this map and left Mexico to appear as an entirely separate entity from North America, primarily because Spain had little to no control over that land.

##### Applied Geographics, Inc., [Mexico - US border infrastructure](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:tx31vv97q) (2000-2010)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3t94b255z/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

In contrast to the older map of Mexico, this newer 2010s map of the same area is spotlighting the connections between the United States and Mexico using details about the border and the infrastructure of the area. This map was made with the purpose of not just showing off the geography of Mexico or being a navigational tool, but instead to highlight the connections between Mexico and the United States and how those two entities interact with one another. Because this map is specifically focusing on the US-Mexico border and the different travel routes into one country and out of the other, the different locations featured on the map are exceptionally detailed and make up most of what is shown. Since the United States played such a large part in this map, both in terms of creating it and also being a focal point of its subject matter, the Southern United States is featured very obviously in white and takes up nearly half of the map, which is not the case in the Ortelius map of 1608.

### Boston

#### William Price, ***[A new plan of ye great town of Boston in New England in America, with the many additionall buildings & new streets to the year 1743](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161952m)*** (1743)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161953w/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" >}}

This 1743 map of Boston shows off the pre-revolution state of the city of Boston and its plans for expansion and development under the British Empire. This “New Plan” for Boston was created by William Price to divide the city into more quadrants and prepare it for more people to be able to live in the metropolis. Because this map is being created with the intent for more people to move here and to make the city look appealing, the buildings and landmarks of Boston are more in focus on this map than things like towns, roads, or other purely practical navigational matters. Looking closely at this map you can see the things that the British valued and what made up the cultural identity of Boston at the time, with the many groupings of houses that make up cozy neighborhoods, the large parks and areas of greenspace and trees, and primarily the wharfs and ports of the city with countless ships drifting in and out. This map is particularly thought provoking towards conceptualizing the space we occupy right now as the area of Back Bay that we are currently standing in was not even a thought in 1743!

#### Chan Krieger & Associates, ***[Boston Over Time : filling in the land 1630 - present](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n559t)*** (2008)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:q524n560k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

This newer map of Boston shows the city at 3 different points in history; 1630 in red, 1880 in green, and 2009 in blue, and highlights specifically how the land of Boston has evolved over time. For many of the maps in this display, the changes seen over time in the maps primarily focus on how people interacted with the land they occupied and what their intent behind creating a map of a certain space was. Contrarily, this map of Boston is a clear marker of how the physical land of the city has changed over time. Looking between this map and the one from 1743, the differences are stark. There is no trace or concept of what is currently the Seaport area on the 1743 map, nor is there any reference to Back Bay or many other parts of Boston that are integral to its identity today.

While we may think solely about people impacting a place and imparting our own identity onto the city we live in, how much of that identity is shaped by the place itself? How much does Boston impart its own identity onto the people that occupy it?
