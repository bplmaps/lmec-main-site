>The Map Center is **soliciting donations in the area of early computer cartography**, including maps, datasets (physical or born-digital), papers, and other cartographic objects produced between 1960 and 2000. In this post, we introduce **two new collections** that exemplify this interest.

Here at the Map Center, we're thrilled to welcome two new archival collections which help narrate the history of computer cartography: the **[Applied Geographics, Inc. Records](https://www.leventhalmap.org/collections/archival-collections/)** and the **David J. Weaver Collection**.

Donated by David Weaver, [founder and former president of Applied Geographics (AppGeo)](https://www.appgeo.com/tribute-to-a-benevolent-founder/), these collections encompass hundreds of cartographic objects including maps, data creation tools, software manuals, and more. 

While the collections have a special focus on maps made by AppGeo, many other authors including Esselte Map Service, Intergraph, and various Massachusetts state agencies are also represented. Taken together, these collections provide a unique glimpse into major changes in cartographic design, process, and philosophy between the late 1970s and 2012.

Since dedicated collections of maps produced during the early days of computer cartography still remain rare, we're eager to collect maps---especially ones created between 1960 and 2000---that reflect:

* **Changes in cartographic practice**. *How did advances in computation affect the look of maps? What conventions and standards were introduced (or erased) as the mapmaking process was increasingly computerized?*
* **Changes methods in spatial analysis**. *How did computer cartography and geographic information systems (GIS) transform the kinds of questions we could ask (and answer) with maps? To what extent did this change the relationship between the map, the mapmaker, and the audience?*
* **Early technical workflows or data creation techniques**. *What novel data creation techniques did advances in computation allow? How was this data analyzed in the form of maps?*

In short: we're interested in maps that bring the process of early computer cartography to life. If you're interested in learning more about this initiative---or if you think you have some maps that fit the above criteria---don't hesitate to [reach out to us](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/geospatial/).

<!-- ### Why "early computer cartography?"

Like many disciplines and professions, cartography underwent radical changes during the advent of computing. In his 1959 article ["Automation and Cartography"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/212211?seq=1), Waldo Tobler suggested we view the map "as a complex data-processing system." This suggestion would prove to be very prescient, as it was only three years later that a team of land use mappers in Canada coined the term "geographic information system."

Ironically, the networks of 

### The Applied Geographics, Inc. Records

In part, this is what makes the collections so distinct:  By focusing on a particular company's impact on GIS across the New England region, these collections add depth to a [well](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C504966) [documented](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C2037006) [history](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/GIS:+A+Short+Introduction-p-9780631235330)

### The David J. Weaver Collection



Today, computer cartography is more commonly known as geographic information systems, or GIS. , or the use of computers to create, store, and analyze spatial data, comprises an important part of our work here at the Map Center. We use GIS software to [make original maps](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4t64k502g), create [data visualizations](https://birds-eye-cards.glitch.me/), and [build tools for exploring historic collections](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org).

In addition to being GIS users, we're also fascinated by how GIS has transformed the practices surrounding cartography and spatial analysis.   nd while the history of GIS has been [fairly](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/GIS:+A+Short+Introduction-p-9780631235330) [well](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C504966) [documented](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C2037006), dedicated collections of maps produced during its early days still remain rare.[^1] That's why  -->

<!-- For example, this **shadeset** was used to {{<popup src="/images/blog/gis2-crop.png" class="popupTooltip" target="blank">}}select colors on an electrostatic plotter.{{</popup>}}Electrostatic plotters were commonly used for map printing in the 1980s and '90s, until laser printing became widely affordable and accessible.

The shadeset bears a good deal of resemblance to modern cartography color pickers, like this editor in ArcGIS Pro or the popular [ColorBrewer tool](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3).  At the same time, the shadeset is a hybrid: produced computationally, but . In other words, resources like the shadeset aren't mere nostalgia for a time when printers were a little different: they help illuminate the material histories and practices associated with geography, computation, and GIS. -->

<!-- ### Major areas of collecting interest



In 1962, the landscape architect Ian McHarg devised [the "layer-cake" method](https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/mcharg-design-with-nature-50th-anniversary/) of visualizing geospatial data. 



Over the next few months, we'll be writing deeper dives . Until then, take a look through some of the recent acquisitions below, or [schedule a visit to explore items from the collection in person](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/).

"Today's GIS professionals may be excused for not knowing the many pathways that comprise the current global mosaic of GIS systems, methods, people, and projoects," writes Timothy W. Foresman in his *History of Geographic Information Systems*. "Indeed thousands of attendees at annual vendor-organized GIS user conferences may be patently ignorant of any specific vendor's place in this history."[^2]

The situation Foresman's observation rings true today, despite the fact that he wrote those sentences in 1998. -->
