When the long-awaited San Francisco Central Subway opened on November 19, 2022, community leaders declared that the 1.7-mile surface light rail system was a pivotal moment for Chinatown. Its completion was celebrated as a milestone for the historical ethnic enclave.

Specifically, one community leader, Malcolm Yeung of the Chinatown Community Development Center, noted that the Central Subway sent a “signal to the city and the world that Chinatown is a permanent part of the fabric of San Francisco” [(KQED, 2022)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/d1kK). In this way, the arrival of Central Subway symbolized a new start while capping more than thirty years of advocacy, planning, and construction that began in the late 1990s.

This essay traces the advocacy of Central Subway as a lens through which to understand historically marginalized communities' relationship more broadly to infrastructure. For many low-income communities of color, such as Chinatown, the arrival of public infrastructure projects has not been a cause for celebration. Previous urban renewal and redevelopment efforts of such neighborhoods, resulting in highway, stadium, and housing construction, have more often than not been associated with the harsh realities of physical destruction and erasure.

Other American Chinatowns have experienced destruction at the hands of infrastructure. The I-5 in Seattle’s International District, the Vine Street Expressway in Philadelphia’s Chinatown, and the Central Artery in Boston’s Chinatown were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, bisecting what were once vibrant and thriving ethnic neighborhoods and leaving physical scars in its wake. The destructive paths of such projects tore apart networks of social relationships constructed over generations as long-time residents and businesses faced eviction and displacement.

Researchers have noted the jarring physical displacement and psychological toll of infrastructure projects on marginalized communities as “infrastructural violence” [(Rodgers & O’Neill, 2012)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/eAhx), referring to deliberate and targeted disruption of the necessary supportive systems to sustain life. Closely related is “infrastructural stigma” [(Baumann & Yacobi, 2022)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/COqm) and how stigma magnifies infrastructural failure, neglect, and absence in marginalized communities. More recently, a different narrative has appeared, in which the usually targeted communities of infrastructural violence are fighting back and resisting the usual outcomes. In this way, Baumann & Yacobi note that such responses denote how ”stigma can be utilised by stigmatised residents to demand connection to public networks, and the wider symbolic inclusion this entails” [(2022, p. 495)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/COqm/?locator=495\&noauthor=1).

San Francisco’s Chinatown is a product of historicized racism, discrimination, and stigmatization. The neighborhood exists due to land use policies that prevented individuals of Chinese descent from settling outside its borders; for nearly a hundred years, it was also impacted by the Chinese Exclusion Act that limited Chinese immigration into the United States. All of this, taken together, distinguishes Chinatown from other post-1965 Chinese-American communities where the lifting of the Exclusion Act and the subsequent Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, also known as the Hart–Celler Act, led to renewed flows of immigration into cities and beyond their borders.

While Chinatown may very much exemplify a model of historically marginalized communities, its leaders’ responses to the Central Subway have differed from what one would normally expect when similar communities encounter infrastructure projects intent on erasing economically and politically disenfranchised communities from their present location and by extension, their place on the maps of cities that they are a part of. If experiences of infrastructural violence are typically what communities see, how should we interpret the seemingly paradoxical ways San Francisco’s Chinatown leaders welcomed the Central Subway?

Articulating the relationship between infrastructure and marginalized communities, especially in Chinatown, requires considering the contextual factors influencing responses. Such questions touch upon pre-existing social imaginaries of Chinatown and how they layer upon the physical and tangible streets, buildings, and other features of Chinatown’s built environment.

In other words, previous experiences, especially close encounters with physical erasure and displacement— may influence when and how infrastructural advocacy is applied as a form of resisting and responding to the typical narrative and expected outcomes of infrastructural violence.  In the following sections, I explore what it means when infrastructural advocacy manifests in a concrete strategy— “putting Chinatown on the map”— which has been an ongoing obsession for Chinatown for nearly a hundred or more years since the 1906 earthquake.

*In the shadow of the 1906 earthquake*

On April 18, 1906, an earthquake struck San Francisco, tumbling buildings and starting a fire that flattened the wooden structures in the city. As Chinatown burned, city officials wasted little time in forming the Committee on the Location of Chinatown to implement a plan created two years prior to evict Chinatown from downtown to the then-remote southeast part of San Francisco [(Ngai, 2006)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/p1j3). Immediately after the earthquake, the [Committee of Forty](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~264259~5524662) recommended street widening changes in the burned district, which had included Chinatown (see Figure 1).

The 1906 addendum to the Burnham Plan for San Francisco shows the planned street widening for what is considered core Chinatown today, bounded by Powell Street to the west, Bush Street to the south, Kearny Street to the west, and Broadway to the north. These plans were never realized largely due to lack of funding and other immediate priorities in the aftermath of the earthquake, but more critically, because merchants in San Francisco’s Chinatown acted quickly.

Through tense negotiations, Chinatown merchants threatened to leave for the neighboring city of  Oakland, taking their revenue-generating trade with them [(Chou, 2013)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/EZxGD). They scrambled to rebuild on their properties as quickly as possible, hiring White European architects who had never been to China to design ornate buildings with flared pagoda tops to flaunt an “Oriental” appearance [(Choy, 2012)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/redi). Through deliberate acts, perhaps even over-exaggerating non-Chinese’s imaginations of Chinese heritage, it appears that merchants engaged in what amounts to “strategic Orientalism” as a strategy to remain in place [(Choy, 2012; Umbach & Wishnoff, 2008)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/EOQ22+redi).

This rapid mobilization illustrates Chinatown’s astute self-awareness in how they were perceived but also suggests a pattern of community leaders capitalizing on such strategies and available resources to preserve the neighborhood and stay in [](http://place.in/)place. In some ways, Chinatown merchants were keen to implement strategies of what geographer Kay Anderson [(1987)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/hJ4cd/?noauthor=1) wrote a few decades later when she coined the “idea of Chinatown.” Anderson envisioned Chinatown as a racialized social construction with material consequences; in other words, Chinatown was more than just a physical space but mapped onto and shaped by cultural and societal imaginations.

Anderson also noted that the existence of Chinatowns and similar segregated ethnic spaces reveal more about the anxieties of those naming “Chinatown” rather than about those being named. Chinatown exists for British Canadian settlers to reinforce the racial boundaries between themselves and Chinese immigrants. Its existence highlights the asymmetry between the two races and is a product of racial ideology; in this case, Anderson argues that Chinatown exists to serve White European cultural hegemony where such ideas map onto physical landscapes.

However, Anderson’s idea of Chinatown did not explore the possible imaginations of how those within Chinatown saw itself, and even less so the idea of Chinatown was leveraged by those from within the community to get additional resources and achieve their self-defined goals. In highlighting narratives of Chinatown as subject to victimization, the community’s relationship to infrastructure was similar to Rodger’s [(2012)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/iJPo/?noauthor=1)’s notion of “abject urbanism” as the acceptance and resignation of community members to counteract the infrastructural violence that they face.

If anything, Chinatown merchants after the 1906 earthquake did the exact opposite. Instead of further stigmatizing and solidifying Chinatown’s marginalization, community leaders after the 1906 earthquake— through its advocacy to quickly rebuild— illustrates how community leaders have capitalized on the idea of Chinatown to fend off threats and ensure that Chinatown would thrive— and specifically, by leveraging acts of putting Chinatown on the map.

Chinatown merchants prevailed in their efforts. Despite facing near erasure, Chinatown constantly had a place on the maps of San Francisco throughout the twentieth-century, particularly as it served the purpose of marketing its tourist appeal and attracting revenue to the city. The San Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau put Chinatown on the map for the [1912 traveler’s guide](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~328333~90096800) in preparation for the Panama-Pacific international Exposition; it was also featured in Gus Schneider, [USNR’s 1950 map](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~291598~90063128) of San Francisco’s Civic Center, showing Chinatown’s proximity to hotels in Union Square and Nob Hill (see Figures 2 and 3).

In examining more contemporary examples of infrastructure advocacy, mainly that of the Central Subway in the following section, one might see how the idea of Chinatown as constantly one step away from physical eradication remains part of the modern imagination of Chinatown. Such anxiety is counterbalanced by the historical precedent that when forced to defend itself against displacement, the community would be able to resist once again against external threats.

*Crisis strikes again in the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake*

Today, the Central Subway is a 1.7-mile underground light rail system that connects the densest neighborhoods in downtown San Francisco with four other underground stations. The southern terminus is the Caltrain depot in the South of Market, passing through the downtown convention and shopping district, with the northern terminus in Chinatown. The Central Subway is the second phase of the Third Street line, in which the first phase is a 6-mile surface light rail that runs through the southeast neighborhoods of the city (see Figure 4).

Planning and advocacy for the Central Subway spans several decades and is often connected to the Embarcadero Freeway, an elevated portion of the U.S. interstate highway system known as State Route 480. The Embarcadero Freeway opened in 1959 as a major east-west connection across San Francisco; it aimed to connect travel from the Golden Gate Bridge in the city’s western neighborhoods to the Bay Bridge in the eastern portion. Additional freeway ramps were added, including one adjacent to Chinatown, at Washington and Clay in 1965.

During this time, the “Freeway Revolt” in San Francisco, as in other major cities across the United States, stopped the construction of several new freeway projects that would have bypassed neighborhoods in the city. On November 5, 1985, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted 8-2 to initiate the demolition of the Embarcadero Freeway and begin preliminary engineering for a tree-lined boulevard and mass transit replacement [(“S.F. Supervisors Move to Demolish ‘Eyesore’ Freeway’,” 1985)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/OZV4).

In 1986, two ballot propositions to initiate the freeway demolition failed by large margins as voters chose not to remove the highway over fears that it would negatively affect Chinatown [(“S.F. Votes to Save the Freeway,” 1986)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/9gWp).

Calls for a Central Subway from Chinatown began in earnest after the Loma Earthquake, which struck on October 17, 1989 and severely damaged a portion of the Embarcadero Freeway. Environmentalists and supporters of the 1986 ballot proposition saw this as an opportunity to finally demolish the freeway. They had the support of Mayor Agnos, who had declared that “San Francisco has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity--a chance to remove one of the worst blights on the face of any American city” [(Stein, M. A., & Kaufman, N., 1990)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/FasG).

For Chinatown merchants, however, the Embarcadero Freeway was called “an economic lifeline”, seen by Chinatown merchants as critical to the economic vitality of Chinatown, as it would ensure continued accessibility and access to the neighborhood for people traveling by automobiles [(“Embarcadero Freeway: Proposal To Demolish Lifeline To Chinatown,” 1989)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/EfmJ). One outspoken leader was Rose Pak, from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, who led the opposition [(Pak, 1990)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/wAMD).

On April 16, 1990, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors considered a proposal to demolish and remove the damaged freeway structure. Chinatown merchants closed their businesses for the day and traveled to City Hall to oppose the removal. Rose Pak was quoted as saying, “It's very arrogant to talk about aesthetics with this riding on the backs of workers and small businessmen… It's not just a freeway, it's our livelihood.'’ [(“San Francisco Sees Bonus in Quake If Reviled Freeway Becomes a Victim,” 1990)](https://paperpile.com/c/c4JtEh/svcG). Despite these efforts, the Board voted 6-5 in support of removing the freeway, and its official demolition began on February 27, 1991.

In effect, the freeway demolition was more than a physical change; it symbolized a death threat to Chinatown. Seeking to restore their economic lifeline and connect Chinatown to the rest of the city, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Chinatown merchants quickly mobilized their attention to a freeway replacement project that would Chinatown’s desire to see improved transport access coincided with the City of San Francisco’s plans to build four major corridors to create a rapid transit network capable of reaching all corners of the city.

In 1995, the San Francisco County Transport Authority published the Four Corridor Plan that called for 2 billion USD in new core subway and rail infrastructure investment. It identified a Downtown subway core connecting the Bayshore corridor along the southeast portion of San Francisco with a crossover at Market Street and a North Beach subway that would connect the Financial District, Chinatown, and Fisherman’s Wharf. These two projects would later manifest as the T Third. Phase 1 created the light rail, which connected the southeastern neighborhoods of the Bayview, Dogpatch, and Visitacion Valley, while Phase 2 consisted of the Central Subway that connected  South of Market and Downtown.

In the 1990s, hundreds of community meetings took place to debate the subway alignment and secure funding for the Central Subway project. Chinatown advocates, including residents from the Ping Yuen Resident Improvement Association, Rose Pak from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and staff from the Chinatown Community Development Center, traveled to Washington D.C. over many years to meet with policymakers and to ensure that Chinatown would not be forgotten for federal transport funding. The subway was initially proposed for the eastern edge of Chinatown, on Kearny Street. Still, Pak and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce advocated to have the subway run directly through the heart of Chinatown on Stockton Street, the neighborhood’s major commercial corridor.

The story ends in favor of Chinatown merchants and their supporters. Today, the Chinatown station is named after Rose Pak, one of the few female leaders in Chinatown whose name is publicly recognized and marked in the neighborhood’s physical buildings and streets and whose significance will be explored in a future chapter.

In Chinese, crisis 危机 is composed of two characters: danger and opportunity. Crisis seems appropriate in framing the responses of Chinatown merchants both after the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes symbolized an existential threat of potential physical eradication through infrastructure. Instead of accepting this fate, they fought back: more specifically, their strategies to defend themselves meant advocating for infrastructure. In rebuilding Chinatown and through advocating for the Central Subway, the idea of Chinatown remained on their minds as a way to forever put Chinatown on the map of the city.

**On the map and here to stay**

Completing the San Francisco Central Subway marked a pivotal moment for Chinatown, symbolizing a triumph that redefines historically marginalized communities' relationship to infrastructure. Against the historical trauma of urban renewal and redevelopment projects that left behind physical destruction and erasure in its path, the Central Subway was a symbol of resistance, an act of infrastructural advocacy by putting “Chinatown on the map."

By establishing a Chinatown station on San Francisco’s public transit system map, the completion of the Central Subway became a concrete strategy emphasizing the neighborhood's permanence and significance.

Moving forward, the story of Chinatown and the Central Subway provides insights for urban planners, policymakers, and community advocates. It underscores the importance of listening to and engaging with marginalized communities' perspectives and desires for infrastructure that respects their identities. Moreover, it reminds us that infrastructure can be a powerful tool for advocacy and empowerment when communities participate in shaping its development. Moreover, the power of infrastructure lies in its ability to place communities on the map, holding immense significance for marginalized communities by reaffirming their existence and identity.
