Every month when I look at our collections to decide what to share on social media, I do a search of the titles of our maps for the name of the month. This always gives me a really interesting look at the variety inherent in our collections! Here's a roundup of some April-related maps from over the centuries.

[This April 1, 1873 plan of Falmouth Heights](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1257bd014) is a classic example of a 19th century map from our collections. It's got a street map in the center and the little vignettes of buildings from the town around the edges, typical of this kind of map at the time! We have plenty of maps in our collection with these detaled little drawings of important landmarks in a city.
