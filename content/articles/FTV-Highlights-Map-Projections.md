> On August 4, we hosted [From The Vault: Map Projections](https://www.leventhalmap.org/event/ftv-marine-landscapes/)! From The Vault is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Map Center staff. For this edition of the series, we looked at objects from our collections that show different kinds of map projections — and if you loved our 2020-21 exhibition [Bending Lines: Maps and Data From Distortion to Deception](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/), read on! 

#### Hendrik Hondius, Nova totivs terrarvm orbis geographica ac hydrographica tabvla (1638)

This beautiful map highlights the baroque style of mapmaking that was favored during the Golden Age of Dutch cartography. The 1600s were the vital time period for the Nicolosi globular projection. Aside from its interesting format, the ornamentation around the spheres illustrate earth, water, fire, and air. The smaller inset map depicts the four known continents with Asia, America, and Africa personified and paying tribute to Europe.
