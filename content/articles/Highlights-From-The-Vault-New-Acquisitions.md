Calling all cartography enthusiasts! Prepare to see some of the newest acquisitions to our collection of over 250,000 maps, atlases, globes, and other cartographic objects. Some chosen for their visual impact, others for their depictions of space and place, and even more for their interpretation of history and relevant information, these maps are sure to educate and impress.

#### Paul Koroleff, [Carte touristique du Liban kharitat Lubnan almusawarat lilsiyaha](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:pr76n698n) (1955)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:g445kk81h/full/,1450/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[A 1955 tourist map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:pr76n698n) of Lebanon, this map acted as a type of advertisement to visit and see the sights. On the bottom right hand side of the map, a number of cities and towns are listed alongside different attractions like resorts, cafes, and historical sites. Most of the text is in Arabic with some English translations, signifying the multicultural audience this brochure is intended for. In addition to the dual language use, the pictorial nature of the map also appeals to those who aren’t able to speak Arabic, ensuring that the map can still be understood with limited language use.

#### Frederic Milton Thrasher, [Chicago's gangland](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:db791j422) (1927)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:dv145x76k/full/,1450/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Showing gangs with clubrooms, those without, and indicating private and public property, this map was meant to be an all-encompassing view of the gangs present in Chicago. Completed as a part of a larger study, the map also lists the names of certain regions and previous illegal activity or attacks that occurred around the area. Something to note is that this map also outlines areas with prevalent ethnic groups, including “Americans” as a broad term for multi-generational White Americans.

#### Joseph Husson, Jr., ***[Map of a Woman’s Heart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kr20j)*** \[1840–1860]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82kr21t/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Illustrating the mysterious land of a woman’s heart, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kr20j) is a comical take on the different facets of love and relationships. Centered on the Ocean of Love, Ideal Isle is disconnected from the rest of the land but just a quick hop from Cape Hope. An arrow (maybe one of Cupid’s?) has pierced the Devotion region of the heart. We can also see the lands Curiosity, Pride, and Hatred and some interesting geographic features, like Mt. Fashion and the Rocks of Despair.

#### Justin Winsor, ***[Boston old and new](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f8662)*** (1880)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:8k71nt56d/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Noted historian and librarian, Justin Winsor created [this unique map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f8662) by superimposing the outline of the original Shawmut Peninsula onto an 1880 map of Boston. It was used as the beginning piece for the first volume of his "Memorial History of Boston, Including Suffolk County, Massachusetts", published in 1882. Though drawn without the assistance of computers or aerial photographs, it remains one of the most vivid diagrams of the radical transformation and enlargement of the Shawmut Peninsula area during the 19th century.

#### Currier & Ives, ***[The true issue or "thats whats the matter"](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fk27g)*** (1864)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:q524nj00d/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

A political cartoon issued shortly after the Democratic Party's nomination of George Brinton McClellan as their Presidential nominee in the election of 1864. [The cartoon](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fk27g) depicts McClellan as the peace candidate. Crying "The Union must be preserved at all hazards!", McClellan attempts to reconcile Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis who are fighting over a large map of the United States with a tear down the center.

Pulling at the Northern side of the map, Lincoln declares, "No peace without Abolition!" Grasping the Southern side of the map, Davis retorts, "No peace without Separation!!" This image, incorporating both caricature and map elements, depicts the significance of the Civil War in American history. The regional tensions of the 1840s and 1850s led to the secession of eleven southern states to form the Confederate States of America and four years of the bloodiest war in American history.

#### Paul Revere, ***[A view of part of the town of Boston in New-England and Brittish \[sic\] ships of war landing their troops! 1768](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90f850d)*** (1870)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:4m90f851p/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

A well known engraver, [this engraved print](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90f850d) depicting British soldiers landing in Boston Harbor in 1768 was done by Paul Revere. The troops were sent to Boston after riots erupted following the passage of the Townshend Acts in London in 1767. A partial view of the city of Boston can be seen in the background with seven prominent church steeples and the cupola of Faneuil Hall.

A key printed beneath the print identifies Long Wharf, Hancock's Wharf, North Battery, and eight of the warships. Additional text beneath the print describes the event in sarcastic terms. An image in the lower right corner of the print mockingly dedicates the print to the Earl of Hillsborough who ordered the British troops to Boston. The image also shows a Native American, a symbol of colonial America, with his foot on the neck of a British soldier.

#### Alexander Gleason, ***[Gleason's new standard map of the world : on the projection of J. S. Christopher, Modern College, Blackheath, England ; scientifically and practically correct ; as "it is."](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149v85z)*** (1892)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149v867/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" >}}

The #1 most searched map in our collection during 2024 is Gleason’s infamous “Flat Earth Map”. Though disbelieved and disproven for hundreds of years, there was a resurgence of “Flat Earthers” in the late 19th century. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149v85z) was included in Gleason’s 1890 book “Is the Bible from Heaven? Is the Earth a Globe?” With its claims to show the earth “as it is,” “scientifically and practically correct,” Gleason's map appealed to the language of cartographic authenticity in order to make a competing claim about the truth.

#### John Bartholomew, ***[Bartholomew's chart of the world on Mercator's projection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kt50p)*** \[1914?]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82kt51z/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

A colorful and intricate example of a world map, the cartographer uses the Mercator's projection to decide on how to portray scale. Maps drawn to the Mercator’s projection became the standard for navigation in the 18th century. Though it makes some regions look larger or smaller in scale than they actually are, this format really grew to popularity because any straight line on the map represents an actual compass bearing. This focus on navigation can be seen in other places on [the map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kt50p), like potential seaweed hazards, the currents, and common ship routes all marked.

#### &#xA;W. E. B. (William Edward Burghardt) Du Bois, ***[The Seventh Ward of Philadelphia](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:gb19h9947)*** \[1899]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:gb19h995h/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

By the end of the century, Philadelphia was home to 40,000 African Americans, comprising the largest population of any northern city. Drawing from the sociological studies by residents of Chicago's Hull House, African American sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois undertook a similar study in Philadelphia, focusing on Ward 7, the location of the city's oldest Black neighborhood. In this community with roughly 9,700 residents, Du Bois and his associates conducted approximately 5,000 interviews. Their findings were published as The Philadelphia Negro (1899), which included [this fold-out map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:gb19h9947) with the location of every residence, church, and business owned by Black people. Today, Philadelphia's Seventh Ward is a trendy middle-class and white neighborhood, but Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church still stands on the edge of this neighborhood. It remains the longest held Black property in the United States while also preserving Black religion, culture, and history.
