> *On January 10, we hosted **From The Vault: New Acquisitions.***

Calling all cartography enthusiasts! Prepare to see some of the newest acquisitions to our collection of over 250,000 maps, atlases, globes, and other cartographic objects. Some chosen for their visual impact, others for their depictions of space and place, and even more for their interpretation of history and relevant information, these maps are sure to educate and impress.

#### Paul Koroleff, [Carte touristique du Liban kharitat Lubnan almusawarat lilsiyaha](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:pr76n698n) (1955)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:g445kk81h/full/,1450/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[A 1955 tourist map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:pr76n698n) of Lebanon, this map acted as a type of advertisement to visit and see the sights. On the bottom right hand side of the map, a number of cities and towns are listed alongside different attractions like resorts, cafes, and historical sites. Most of the text is in Arabic with some English translations, signifying the multicultural audience this brochure is intended for. In addition to the dual language use, the pictorial nature of the map also appeals to those who aren’t able to speak Arabic, ensuring that the map can still be understood with limited language use.

#### Frederic Milton Thrasher, [Chicago's gangland](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:db791j422) (1927)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:dv145x76k/full/,1450/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Showing gangs with clubrooms, those without, and indicating private and public property, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:db791j422) was meant to be an all-encompassing view of the gangs present in Chicago. Completed as a part of a larger study, the map also lists the names of certain regions and previous illegal activity or attacks that occurred around the area. Something to note is that this map also outlines areas with prevalent ethnic groups, including “Americans” as a broad term for multi-generational White Americans.

#### Boris Artzybasheff, [World map of the major tropical diseases](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6q185975n) (1944)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1z40ph33g/full/1450,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map shows the locations of diseases around the world using text, illustrations and color to grab the viewer’s attention. Included at the foot of the map is a description of each disease, how it’s typically contracted, and how it’s most often treated. 15 diseases are represented here, including malaria, yellow fever, dengue, typhus, plague, cholera, sleeping sickness, tularemia, Rocky Mountain fever, Japanese river fever, relapsing fever, helminthic diseases, yaws, leprosy, and leishmaniasis. 

Created for LIFE Magazine in 1944, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6q185975n) would have been highly accessible to the public. This is especially important given the time frame of Americans entering the army and beginning to fight abroad in World War 2. 

#### Nancy Morita, [The ecology and natural history of San Francisco wild in the city](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C9000010) (1992)

{{< figure src="https://planetdrum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_wild_in_city.jpg" class="" >}}

[This poster-style map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C9000010) compares a view of the natural geography of San Francisco before colonization (1750) with a then present-day (1990s) street map to show what features could be restored to their natural state. The natural side of the map shows the location of the sand dunes, grasslands, wildflower-butterfly hilltops, Ohlone village sites, creek paths, salt marshes, and berry-brushlands that “underlie” the city of San Francisco. 

This map was created, in part, to reintroduce the natural landscape to San Franciscans and help them understand how it continued to influence their lives in the urbanized city 200+ years later. One example is to help explain why some people’s basements flood or buildings sink. This map was also attempting to help city dwellers connect more with urban wildlife and strengthen their connection with local wild areas’ restoration efforts.

#### General Drafting Company, [America's products and the trucks that carry them](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8919287) (1958)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Screenshot 2025-01-10 105012.png" >}}

This is [a 1958 General Drafting Company pictorial map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8919287) of the United States, its industry, and the transportation network used to move its products. The map follows the 1956 Federal-Aid Highway Act, celebrating the success of the American Highway system and the hard work of truckers in moving goods along a growing network of interstate trade. 

Pictorial vignettes highlight American production, from agricultural goods to aircraft parts and automobiles. Corn, potatoes, walnuts, citrus fruit, and flour appear among the nation's agricultural products. Coal, lead, uranium ore, copper, aluminum, and phosphates are named among the nation's mineral resources. Farm machinery, shoes, synthetic rubber, textiles, and paper represent a handful of manufactured products. America's highway network, illustrated below the green vignettes in shades of gray, serves as a network of commerce. The trucks that create the map's border carry it all, with many still in use today. Many of these were designed with specific purposes in mind: logging, beverage panel trucks, telephone line trucks, bulk milk trucks, ice cream trucks, and vehicle carriers, etc. 

#### Walker Lith., [Canobie Lake Park, Salem N.H.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633j682j) (1912)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:5d86s675x/full/1450,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Canobie Lake Park is a staple of New England summers. Now known for their roller coasters and Taylor Swift impersonator, the park was originally a “trolley park” located at the end of the Massachusetts Northeast Street Railway Company and was designed to encourage trolley use on the weekends. To that end, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633j682j) was initially designed as a foldable brochure. At the time of this map’s creation in 1912, Canobie Lake Park consisted of flower gardens, walking paths, and “gentle attractions” like a swimming pool.

#### Alexander Gleason, ***[Gleason's new standard map of the world : on the projection of J. S. Christopher, Modern College, Blackheath, England ; scientifically and practically correct ; as "it is."](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149v85z)*** (1892)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149v867/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" >}}

The #1 most searched map in our collection during 2024 is Gleason’s infamous “Flat Earth Map”. Though disbelieved and disproven for hundreds of years, there was a resurgence of “Flat Earthers” in the late 19th century. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149v85z) was included in Gleason’s 1890 book “Is the Bible from Heaven? Is the Earth a Globe?” With its claims to show the earth “as it is,” “scientifically and practically correct,” Gleason's map appealed to the language of cartographic authenticity in order to make a competing claim about the truth.

#### John Bartholomew, ***[Bartholomew's chart of the world on Mercator's projection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kt50p)*** \[1914?]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82kt51z/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

A colorful and intricate example of a world map, the cartographer uses the Mercator's projection to decide on how to portray scale. Maps drawn to the Mercator’s projection became the standard for navigation in the 18th century. Though it makes some regions look larger or smaller in scale than they actually are, this format really grew to popularity because any straight line on the map represents an actual compass bearing. This focus on navigation can be seen in other places on [the map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kt50p), like potential seaweed hazards, the currents, and common ship routes all marked.

#### &#xA;W. E. B. (William Edward Burghardt) Du Bois, ***[The Seventh Ward of Philadelphia](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:gb19h9947)*** \[1899]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:gb19h995h/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

By the end of the century, Philadelphia was home to 40,000 African Americans, comprising the largest population of any northern city. Drawing from the sociological studies by residents of Chicago's Hull House, African American sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois undertook a similar study in Philadelphia, focusing on Ward 7, the location of the city's oldest Black neighborhood. In this community with roughly 9,700 residents, Du Bois and his associates conducted approximately 5,000 interviews. Their findings were published as The Philadelphia Negro (1899), which included [this fold-out map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:gb19h9947) with the location of every residence, church, and business owned by Black people. Today, Philadelphia's Seventh Ward is a trendy middle-class and white neighborhood, but Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church still stands on the edge of this neighborhood. It remains the longest held Black property in the United States while also preserving Black religion, culture, and history.
