Alan Leventhal—the son of our founder Norman B. Leventhal, a long-time supporter of our work, and the Chair of our Board of Directors from 2020 to 2022—was recently [sworn in as the U.S. Ambassador to Denmark](https://www.majorityleader.gov/content/hoyer-statement-senate-confirmation-alan-leventhal-ambassador-denmark). To celebrate Alan’s new role, let's take a tour of maps and materials about Denmark from the Leventhal Center and BPL collections. 

### Copenhagen under siege

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:ht2502616/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" >}}

While the foreign relations between Scandinavian countries are now friendly, Denmark and Sweden have a history of conflict—in fact, according to one measure, they have [fought each other more often than any other two countries in world history](https://twitter.com/denmarkinusa/status/889923203560120321?lang=en). This map of Copenhagen from the late seventeenth century was produced to illustrate a [history of the Swedish Empire](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22De+rebus+a+Carolo+Gustavo+Sueciae%22) by the German political theorist Samuel von Pufendorf. The map shows the Swedes’ 1658 siege of Copenhagen, which was was ultimately unsuccessful, in part due to the city’s strong fortifications. Today’s U.S. embassy is located [just outside of the city’s historic bastion wall](https://elisharesearch.com/2020/09/25/the-old-fortifications-of-copenhagen-and-how-it-shaped-the-city-today/). This map also appears in _[Mapping a World of Cities](https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/mapping-a-world-of-cities/),_ our collaborative timeline of urban historical cartography.

### A pictorial Denmark

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f4639955/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="figure-right" >}}

This caricature map of Denmark appeared was printed in Lilian Lancaster and William Harvey’s 1868 book _[Geographical Fun](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?f%5Bname_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Lancaster%2C+Elizabeth+Lilian%2C+1852-1939)._ Caricature maps like this one often offered lighthearted commentary on serious topics, like the [famous octopus map that appeared in our _Bending Lines_ exhibition](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/why-persuade/1.5.1/). In this illustration of Denmark, the “royal spirit” of the nation is “shrinking from unclean beasts that grin below”—almost certainly a reference to Prussia, which [in 1864 had annexed the territories of Schleswig-Holstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Schleswig_War) at the foot of the Jutland peninsula.

### A nation poking out into the North Sea

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x059cb25h/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" >}}

While the titular topic of this 1870 map is “Berlin and its defenses,” this unique bird’s eye perspective gives an excellent window into the geographic relationship between Denmark, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries. With its complicated structure of peninsulas and islands dividing the North Sea from the Baltic Sea, Denmark has always been played a key role in the geopolitics of northern Europe. Maritime traffic from important cities like St. Petersburg, Gdańsk, and Lübeck must pass through one of three passages: the Øresund near Copenhagen (labeled here as “The Sound”), the Great Belt separating the island of Zealand from Funen, or the Little Belt separating Funen from the Jutland peninsula. During the climatological period known as the [Little Ice Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age), the Swedish army was able to [cross the Little Belt when it froze in 1658](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26219050?seq=1), setting up the siege described in the first map and offering an early example of how the global climate system can impact political conflicts.

### The tragedy of a Prince of Denmark

This isn’t a map, of course, but it’s one of the most notable examples of a Danish character playing a role in English literature—Shakespeare’s _Hamlet_, which is set in medieval Denmark. The BPL’s Rare Books Department, which will reopen to the public later this year after a major renovation, is home to the [Thomas Pennant Barton Collection](https://archive.org/details/bplsctpbs), an important collection of Shakespeare material. This 1611 edition of _Hamlet_ was published just a decade after Shakespeare first wrote this enduringly provocative play.

### A cycling map of a green city

{{< figure src="/uploads/2022-06-22/copenhagen-cycle-map-excerpt.jpg" >}}

This map isn’t yet in our collections, but it captures one of Denmark’s most famous modern features: its extensive system of bicycle-friendly streets and paths. Denmark has been at the forefront of efforts to address climate change (a topic that’s also [of interest to the new ambassador](https://commonwealthmagazine.org/environment/all-hands-on-deck-to-address-climate-crisis/)!), and [moving people into more low-carbon methods of getting around](https://use.metropolis.org/case-studies/cycling-in-copenhagen) has been a major goal for the country. This map of Copenhagen shows some of the major routes for bicycling around the city.

Luckily, when Alan is stationed in Copenhagen, he won’t have to feel _too_ far away from a world-class collection of historical geography. The Danish Royal Library has [one of Northern Europe’s largest map collections](https://www.kb.dk/en/find-materials/collections/map-collection). From all of us at the Leventhal Center, we wish the best to Alan in his new role—and we can foresee many trans-Atlantic cartographic adventures to come.
