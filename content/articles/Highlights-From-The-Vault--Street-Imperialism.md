> *On August 22, we hosted **From The Vault — Street Imperialism: Cities at the Onset of Colonization.***

**A city plan is a window into a city’s culture and ways of life.**

Unfortunately, most historic urban maps that have made their way into modern collections were created by European and American cartographers and primarily depict cities designed or strongly influenced by the European practices. This leaves many peoples, cities, and cultures cartographically underrepresented.

This From the Vault map collections showing highlights maps in our collections that depict global, pre-industrial cities that were founded by non-European cultures.

#### Sebastian Münster, [Il Cvscho citta principale della provincia del Perv](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3x81cq09n) (1572)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:jm219r09q/full/2225,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Once the capital of the Inca Empire, Cusco was conquered by the Spanish Empire in 1534, and became capital of the province of Peru. Although its contemporary culture is heavily influenced by its Spanish background, Cusco retains its Inca ancestry. Notice the grid layout of the city—a deliberate choice by Inca planners, inherited by the Spanish administration. A Dutch cartographer made [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3x81cq09n) only a few decades after the conquest, so the indigenous culture was still prominently visible throughout Cusco. At this time, many denizens of Cusco would have remembered the large terraced cathedral on the left of the map as an Incan temple and palace.

#### Carl Crow, [\[Illustrated historical map of Shanghai\]](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f974z) (1935)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:qb98n805r/full/2225,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map was designed by advertising executive Carl Crow to attract English-speaking visitors into Shanghai, back then one of the world’s largest cities. China was an independent republic, but was dependent on Western powers such as the United States and Britain. [Crow’s map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f974z) depicts a neighborhood known as the “International Settlement,” its location within the city shown on the bottom left. In many ways, Shanghai’s European residents were the city’s ‘elite.’ They enjoyed special privileges, not afforded to the Chinese residents. For instance, the “Public Garden” in the center of the map, was infamously closed to Chinese visitors, restricted to white patrons only.

#### United States. Adjutant-General's Office. Military Information Division, [Military map of the isle of Luzon](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cc08kx74j) (1900)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:tx31t1153/full/2225,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This map of the Philippine island of Luzon](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cc08kx74j) was made by the U.S. Military during the Spanish-American War of 1898. The city of Manila, on the right, was the capital of the Spanish colony of the Philippines, and one of the most important trade cities in southeast Asia. The predominant ethnic group in Manila were the criollo, island-born people of mixed Spanish and indigenous Tagalog descent. They were considered of lower status than the landowning descendants of Spanish nobility. Shortly before the United States took over the Philippines, the city became a battleground for the Philippine Revolution against Spanish rule. Consider how the separation of the city by rivers and canals may have literally split the elites from the creole masses.

#### François Levernay, [Plan de l'isthme de Suez, de Port-Said, Ismailia et Suez pour servir d'annexe au guide général d'Egypte](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht250c09t) (1868)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:ht250c10k/full/2225,/0/default.jpg" >}}

The Suez Canal was one of the most ambitious projects of the 19th century, a connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Egypt was then ruled by the Khedive Isma’il Pasha, who sold the rights for construction to a French company. The three cities depicted on the top of the map were all company towns, built specifically to house tens of thousands of laborers, many of whom were forced to work by French authorities. The conditions were very poor, with thousands of workers dying from diseases like cholera. A year after [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht250c09t) was published, the port of Ismailia held a lavish opening ceremony for the canal, attended by the rulers and ambassadors of many European countries.

#### Geo. H. Walker & Co, *[Boston Harbor](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ng454q77c)* (1897)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9k422m36m/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Published in 1897 by the Walker Lithograph & Publishing Company, Boston Harbor provides a bird’s eye view of the harbor, including the major landmarks and steamboat routes characterizing Boston’s shoreline. Centered on this map are the economic strongholds of 1800s Boston: industrial South Boston, the historic waterfront along Atlantic Avenue in Downtown Boston, and the major East Boston shipping and rail hub connecting Boston to northern New England and the world. This map also highlights many Revolutionary and Civil War-era island forts scattered throughout the harbor, and offers a glimpse into the picturesque coastal village towns surrounding the heart of the harbor.

From this aerial view, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ng454q77c) illustrates the local ferry connections that carried people through the harbor during the golden age of the steamboat. In the bottom left-hand corner of the frame, the East Boston Ferries run between Lewis Mall Wharf in East Boston and “Steam Boat Landing” in the North End, which shipbuilders and dock workers might’ve used to get to and from work on the waterfront. And departing from Lewis Wharf, Central Wharf, and Rowes Wharf are the ferries that brought passengers to the region’s summertime retreats: Winthrop via the Winthrop Steamboat Company, Nahant via the “Nahant Line Steamers,” and Hull via the Nantasket Beach Steamboat Company.

#### Nantasket Beach Steamboat Company, *[Boston to Nantasket Beach and Plymouth](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fq413)* \[ca. 1915]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fq42c/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Through the early 20th century, Hull became famous for Nantasket Beach and Paragon Park, which attracted summer vacationers from all over Greater Boston. The Nantasket Beach Steamboat Company grew a successful business by bringing passengers from Boston and Hingham via ferry across Boston Harbor. The steamboat company also ran to Plymouth, offering easy access to a quiet retreat on the historic waterfront.

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fq413) was originally part of a promotional pamphlet advertising the Nantasket Beach Steamboat Company’s service to these fashionable summer destinations. Paragon Park has since closed, but Nantasket Beach continues to be a popular summertime beach destination. 

The MBTA runs regular commuter ferry service to Hull as part of the Hingham-Hull-Logan Airport-Boston route, which expands the utility of the ferry beyond vacationing. Today, there is no ferry service connecting Boston to Plymouth.

#### Boston & Gloucester Steamship Co., *[Boston & Gloucester Steamboat Co.: summer season 1889](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp956)* (1889)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fp96g/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Seaside retreats and ferries that toured the coastlines have been popular summer vacation activities since the advent of the steamboat. In the late 1800s, Gloucester was a popular long-distance ferry destination for Bostonians. [This brochure](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp956) was distributed in the summer of 1889 by the Boston & Gloucester Steamboat Company to promote its recreational ferry service to Gloucester. These trips were just as much about sight-seeing from the ferry as they were about reaching the vacation destination.

Today, taking a ferry to one of Greater Boston’s many quaint coastal towns is still one of the summer’s best activities to do on the water. The MBTA runs ferries to Hull, which is most well known for the beautiful Nantasket Beach. Boston Harbor City Cruises also runs private, long-distance ferries to Provincetown via the Cape Cod Fast Ferry out of Downtown Boston and Salem. Alternatively, you can also get to the Cape from Boston’s Seaport via Bay State Cruise Company’s Provincetown Fast Ferry.
