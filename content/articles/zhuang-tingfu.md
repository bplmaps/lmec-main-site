In 1794 the Chinese scholar Zhuang Tingfu (莊廷尃, 1728--1800) produced a
large manuscript map of the world with the long title *The Great Qing
Dynasty world map of tribute bearing countries with spherical
coordinates, past and present* (大清統職貢萬國經緯地球式方輿古今圖 or *Daqing tong zhigong wanguo jingwei
diqiushi fangyu gujin tu*).
This map is now in the collections of the [Library of Congress](http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3200.ct003384). As we shall see, this
manuscript map was created after an encounter with Europeans, and, six years later, it was
copied in an abridged manuscript edition. The creation of that later
edition, now in the MacLean Collection, led to additional encounters, and the printing of these cartographic echoes continued for decades into the middle
nineteenth century.


From the second paragraph of the lengthy lower inscription of Zhuang's 1794
map, we learn that a British envoy had arrived in Beijing in 1793 to pay
tribute to the Chinese emperor. Britain had sent George Macartney
(1737--1806) to establish the first British embassy in Beijing, part of a mission  sponsored by the
British crown and the East India Company. Over three months of
encounters, we know several of the Macartney Mission's 92
members presented maps and globes to their Chinese counterparts as part
of official and unofficial exchange. No doubt these included one of the
world maps recently produced in Britain that included the
circumnavigations of Commodore John Byron (1765), Captain Samuel Wallis
(1767), Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1768) and in particular Captain
James Cook's three well-known voyages (1768-71, 1772-75, and 1776-79), amongst others.

One possible map candidate exchanged was Robert Sayer's (ca.
1724-94) *A General Map of the World or Terraqueous Globe* from 1787, like this one
from the MacLean Collection.

Sayer's map presents a double-hemisphere globular projection of the
world. It included many dotted and sometimes interesecting lines which showed labeled historic circumnavigation routes around the world. Amongst the routes shown on Sayer's map are the
multiple routes of Bougainville and Cook through the Society,
Friendly, and Marquesas Islands of the South Pacific.

Surrounding the maps themselves are insets, typical of European maps of
the period. These insets cover a wide range of geological topics and celestial mechanics
like the phases of the earth as it circles the sun, here beautifully
depicted like a blooming flower, with a face on the sun.

This diagram, entitled the "The Vicissitude of Seasons Explained,"
illustrates and describes the relative light and darkness according to
the earth's position with respect to the sun at the beginning of each of
the twelve zodiac signs over the course of a year.

In 1800 in China, Zhuang abridged his original map and produced a copy using the
same title: *The Great Qing Dynasty world map of tribute bearing
countries with spherical coordinates, past and present*. This newly revised
copy of the map included the
lower double-hemisphere globular projection maps and the lengthy lower
inscription, here presented with the inscription above the maps. This
manuscript map, currently in the MacLean Collection, is now mounted as a
hanging scroll drawn in ink and color on paper.

The map was dated and signed, "Jiajing (reign) fifth year (1800), the
*gengshen* (year), last month of summer (August). Maps and descriptions
planned and edited by Zhuang Tingfu from Jinling."

According to the closing inscription, the map was created in 1800 as
part of an imperial edition of 31 records prepared exclusively
to be placed in the Imperial Archives Library in Beijing. The MacLean Collection's
map, which formed a part of this group of maps and documents, was produced in
celebration of important documents originally produced during Emperor
Qianlong's lengthy reign from 1736-95; the year 1800 marked the
one-year anniversary of Qianlong's death. Examining the South Pacific shows
a detail similar to the one shown on Sayer's European map. Zhuang's maps also shows
hash-marked routes with toponyms such a Dog Island (*quandao*) and Saint
Bernanado (*shengbaiernaduo*) in the Society Islands.

These islands had become part of European geographic knowledge after Byron's journey, and this depicted route
may be his voyage of 1765. Another hash-marked route through the
Marquesas Islands (*mengduose*) likely shows the trace of Cook's passage in 1774.
Although Zhuang does not label these hash-marked routes, they seem likely
to have been faithfully copied from a British original, such as the Sayer map---possibly without
full understanding of their meaning.

The relatively recent rediscovery of Zhuang's 1800 map has shed light on
other related encounters and subsequent cartographic productions. There
is textual and visual evidence that Korean envoys and scholars were able
to view Zhuang's 1800 map. In Korea in 1834, Zhuang's 1800 map was
rendered into a pair of woodblock-printed maps produced through the
collaboration of Kim Jeongho (金正浩, 1804--66?) and Choe Hangi (崔漢綺, 1803--77).

Kim and Choe produced a set of four maps consisting of a pair of
terrestrial maps and a pair of celestial maps. These were entitled *Maps of the
Front and Back \[hemispheres\] of the Globe* (地球前後圖 or *Jigu jeonhudo*) and the *Maps of the Fixed Stars of the Northern and
Southern Yellow Road* (黃道北南恆星圖 or *Huangdo boknamhang seongdo*). Kim
Jeongho, perhaps Korea's best-known geographer and cartographer, was
known for his massive *Territorial Map of the Great East* (*Daedong
yeojido*) of 1861. Choe Hangi was a polymath, bibliophile and a prolific
writer.

The 1834 maps present a
to-scale pair of terrestrial maps in the same double-hemisphere globular
format as Zhuang's 1800 map. The most obvious difference is the total
lack of an inscription on the Korean maps of 1834. These maps do, however,
include all the toponyms and other details of the 1800 map, including the
hash-marked maritime voyages of European explorers.

That Zhuang's 1800 map was known in Korea can also be confirmed in an encyclopedia created by Yi
Gyugyeong (李圭景, 1788--1856) titled *Oju's Scattered Manuscripts
of Glosses and Comments* (五洲衍文長箋散稿 or *Oju yeonmun jangjeon sango*). This encyclopedia was
compiled in the 1840s, some ten years after Kim and Choe's map. It has
an entry with the map's description, the entire inscription from
Zhuang's 1800 map and a description of the 1834 world maps created by Kim and Choe. This confirms
not only an encounter but the importance of the Zhuang 1800 map and the
*Maps of the Front and Back \[hemispheres\] of the Globe* at the time; two decades later, in 1857, Choe included them in his *Essential
Geography of the World* (地球典要). Yi, Kim, and Choe all had
access to some version of the Zhuang 1800 map. How and why this came to
pass is still unknown, but all three felt it should play an active part
in an emerging Korean world geography.

Zhuang's 1800 map was printed as well as updated and enhanced in China
well into the middle of the nineteenth century. At some point an undated
printed version was produced; the MacLean Collection also has a copy of this later version. The maps and texts are faithfully copied, including the hash-marked
routes, on the printed version, although the overall scale is increased
slightly.

There is an informative hand-written annotation in English on this map
confirming a European missionary's encounter with Zhuang's 1800
original. Robert Morrison (1782--1834), a Scottish Protestant missionary,
arrived in China in 1807 and spent the following twenty-seven years
based in Macao. In 1817 he published his book *A View of China, for
Philological Purposes; Containing a Sketch of Chinese Chronology,
Geography. Government, Religion and Customs*. On page 6 of that work,
Morrison cites having seen Zhuang's 1800 map of the world. And the
anonymous hand-written annotation on the top right of the printed Zhuang
copy in the MacLean Collection quotes and cites Morrison's encounter
with Zhuang's 1800 map.

The MacLean Collection has another Zhuang Tingfu inspired map: the
printed *Map of the World* (萬國輿圖) dated to 1858.

There are numerous similarities and differences both visually and
textually between Zhuang's 1800 map and this 1858 map. Visually, the
presentation of a lengthy horizontal inscription above the double
hemisphere globular map is similar, although the main text is
abridged in the 1858 map. The first difference is the scale of the overall presentation
of the maps proper, with the 1858 map thrice the size of the 1800 map.
Another difference is that the hemispheres in the 1858 map are reversed.

It's important to note that a conscious decision has been made to
re-orient the two hemispheres. The typical European orientation places
the Americas on the left, as seen on Zhuang's 1800 map, which was likely based
on a European map. The 1858 map orientation places the Americas to the
right, positioning China in the center of the world visually between the
two hemispheres.

Another difference is the hash-marked lines of the
various European's circumnavigations are absent. The 1858 map also
includes information of geographic features that only became known to European and
Chinese geographers later than 1800, such as Lake Chad discovered in the 1820s in
Central Africa, the separation of Mexico and Texas in the 1820s, the
Great Salt Lake discovered in the 1830s, and Sabrina Land, south of
Australia, discovered by Europeans in the 1840s.

  caption="Chinese character for \"map\" (*Tu*) in the title of [*Map of the World*](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:v405wq01x)"
  class="figure-right"
>}}

The 1858 map also has differences that enhance the overall presentation.
The large separated characters of the title itself are each a pastiche
of floral and abstract design elements with shading added to imply
three-dimensionality.

This kind of stylized decorative font can be found on other
contemporaneous maps of East Asia, in a manner similarly found on
American commercial wall maps for example published in the nineteenth
century where the use of highly stylized titles and decorative borders
were ubiquitous.

The 1858 map, like the Sayer map, is surrounded by insets of geological
topics, here depicting the world's highest mountains and volcanoes in
the bottom corners, and the more familiar insets related to celestial
mechanics, including the same diagram of sunlight over the course of a
year. Similar to the Sayer map's "Vicissitude of Seasons," the figure here is named "Diagram of the
Topography of the twenty-four fortnightly Periods over One Year"
(*zhounian jieqi dixing tu*).

Boldly colored, also resembling a blooming flower, here the sun is red with a
gold-leaf character for "sun" in the center while the outer ring depicts
the earth over twelve months and the relative positions of light and
darkness according to the time of year.

We have briefly considered the life of a historical map made in China
and related questions. Like what happened after it was made? Where was
it viewed and by whom? Zhuang's 1800 manuscript map was the source for
an astonishing number of encounters and echoes during the nineteenth
century---and questions persist.

What was it about this map that made it
so popular? And how did so many people from so many different countries
get access to it in Beijing? Its rediscovery in the MacLean Collection
has not only brought together related materials in the collection but also pointed to numerous interesting encounters and links
connecting the past with the present.
