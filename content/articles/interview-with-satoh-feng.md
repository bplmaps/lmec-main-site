Satoh, welcome to the Leventhal Center! We’re excited to have you on the team. Tell us a bit about your background and what you’re studying at Northeastern.

Hello, I'm Satoh, a design major student at Northeastern. Most of my art work focus revolves around 2D and 3D work, encompassing 3D modeling, carpentry, watercolor, and 2D animations. The majority of my coursework at Northeastern has been design-oriented, covering areas such as graphic design, typography, and 3D modeling.

Nevertheless, Design is not just about art. It is also about solving problems for users. by communication and understanding the needs of users, by brainstorming sessions to generate creative solutions. I believe that this mindset and approach can be applied effectively in the work environment here, allowing for a thoughtful understanding of user requirements and the development of targeted solutions.

What made you want to work at the Leventhal Center for your coop experience?

When I reflect on my own artistic works, I realize a profound issue which is that my artworks lack the depth of time and literary knowledge. I believe that truly exceptional design or art requires time for contemplation and a foundation in literature and history. It is upon these foundations that one can create something truly outstanding.

I am eager to undertake projects that I have never attempted before, looking forward to stepping out of my comfort zone. This is precisely why I am drawn to the Leventhal Center. I envision it as an opportunity to immerse myself in an environment that encourages thoughtful exploration, allowing me to infuse my artistic endeavors with the richness of time, literature, and history.

What is your earliest memory of maps? (and/or museums/libraries?)

I remember when I was a child, my parents put two giant maps in my bedroom, almost covering the entire wall. One was a map of China, and the other was a world map. However, I have to say that I wasn't interested in the densely packed text on these maps when I was a child; I wasn't even willing to take a glance. Perhaps it was influenced by my dad because I still remember a time when I watched him use the computer. He zoomed in on the map to locate our home and gradually explored some famous landmarks near our house.

It wasn't until university, after entering Northeastern, that I started traveling to various places like Mexico, Miami, and New York (although I haven't been to many places). I didn't want to waste any of my travel experiences, so after each trip, I began to look at maps, trying to see the route we had taken from a different perspective.

Moreover, what I find more interesting about looking at maps is comparing the old maps with the current ones. It's fascinating to see what changes have occurred in the details on these maps over the years.

What are you most excited to start working on?

I am really excited to look forward to contributing to any future projects, intending to present historical narratives through my unique art style. I aspire to captivate the attention of visitors of different age groups by employing diverse styles tailored to their interests. What excites me the most is the prospect of different artistic styles colliding, creating a dynamic and visually compelling experience.

Additionally, I anticipate engaging in discussions with different visitors about their interpretations. Visitors from different cultural backgrounds often hold distinct perspectives and stories about the same event or map. The historical events that unfolded in the past are not always unequivocal, but through the voices of different individuals, we can sense the profound impact of these stories on people. It is through these varied voices that we gain a deeper understanding of how these historical narratives resonate with individuals.

Furthermore, I am really interested in the upcoming exhibition, "The Blue Maps of China." Lastly, as a Chinese individual, I take great pride in the fact that our history will be showcased. I am eager to contribute to this project by leveraging my own cultural background to ensure its successful presentation.
