July 4th is Independence Day in the United States, a day commemorating the ratification of the Declaration of Independence of the colonies from Great Britain. Today, we associate the holiday with the nebulous concept of freedom. But who was free on July 4th, 1776? Who is free today? What do we celebrate when we set off fireworks and have cook outs on Independence Day, and what histories are swept under the rug in the process?

Perhaps most obviously, many people in the colonies were still enslaved in 1776. By the Civil War, there were [nearly four million people](https://thomaslegioncherokee.tripod.com/distributionofslavesinunitedstateshistory.html) enslaved in the US. These people did not have the rights of American citizens in spite of living here, and in many cases having been born here. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:xg94j2112) drawn after the Mexican-American War shows free and slave states as well as territories that had yet to be carved into states in 1848, and therefore had not yet decided their position on slavery. The map is surrounded by state emblems, emphasizing the tenuous balance between states which did and did not maintain slavery as an active practice.

Discussions of slavery often focus on the south, including in [this famous map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:w9505r836) of enslaved populations in southern states. Even in states without people enslaved, lots of wealth came from enslavement. In Massachusetts, for example, although slavery was illegal starting in 1783, the clothing mills still operated based on slave-picked cotton, rum for distilleries came from plantations in the Caribbean, and many more of the goods that were shipped through Boston and made it a wealthy port city were created through slave labor.

The Fifteenth Amendment is one of the amendments to the Constitution made during Reconstruction, after the Civil War and the national abolition of chattel slavery. The Amendment sought to secure voting rights for Black men following their release from enslavement. [This lithograph](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n5781) has a celebratory feel to it, illustrated as it is with famous people of the time who contributed to what was seen as the advancement of African Americans. These include Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, [Martin Dulany, and Hiram Rhodes Revels](https://americanhistory.si.edu/brown/pdf/Unit1/2.Teacher.15th%20Amendment%20Print.pdf). In spite of the congratulatory air of this piece, voting was still denied to most Black Americans thorugh poll taxes and tests. And while chattel slavery was eliminated, slave labor is still legal in the United States as punishment of a crime. The United States has the highest population of incarcerated people of any country in the world.

Also illustrated in the lithogrpah above are scenes of Black children attending school, a freedom denied to them during slavery. Schools were not universally a source of freedom, though. Across the continent, young Indigenous people were forced to attend boarding schools or reservation schools that would teach them to be American rather than Native. The news from Canada recently about the bodies of children found at residential schools is appalling. Canada is not alone in its genocidal practices against Indigenous people in the Americas. The US also had residential schools which functioned as a way to "kill the Indian, save the man" in each child torn from their families and culture and forced to assimilate or suffer the consequences. The difference between Canadian and American approaches is not that there are mass graves in Canada and not in the US, but that Canadians are digging for them and Americans haven't started yet. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:js957749v) of American reservations marks each school with a red shape.

The right to vote is supposedly a founding principle of the United States, but who could vote at the outset of our country? Not Black men, as discussed above, and certainly not Native Americans, who were not citizens until 1924. Women also did not have the vote in 1776; only white, propertied men could choose their representatives in government. [This 1919 Victory Map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9g54xm04t) shows each state's position on women's suffrage and includes the year women obtained the vote in each place. 

While the right to vote was extended universally to women in 1920 with the 19th amendment, there are a couple of important caveats. One is that in fact women had obtained the right to vote in many western states along with the founding of the states themselves, and in other states had municipal suffrage or other partial victories. The other caveat is that even after 1920, Black and Indigenous women were prevented from voting until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Today, populations in some cities are still de facto prevented from voting because of long lines and limited hours at polling places. Residents without citizenship, people convicted of felonies, residents in some territories, and others do not have the vote. When we celebrate the Fourth of July, it's important to realize precisely what we have achieved, that it was realized through lots of hard work, and that there is plenty of work still to be done. Happy Independence Day!
