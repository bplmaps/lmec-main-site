July 4th is Independence Day in the United States, a day commemorating the ratification of the Declaration of Independence of the colonies from Great Britain. Today, we associate the holiday with the nebulous concept of freedom. But who was free on July 4th, 1776? Who is free today? What do we celebrate when we set off fireworks and have cook outs on Independence Day, and what histories are swept under the rug in the process?

Perhaps most obviously, many people in the colonies were still enslaved in 1776. By the Civil War, there were [nearly four million people](https://thomaslegioncherokee.tripod.com/distributionofslavesinunitedstateshistory.html) enslaved in the US. These people did not have the rights of American citizens in spite of living here, and in many cases having been born here. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:xg94j2112) drawn after the Mexican-American War shows free and slave states as well as territories that had yet to be carved into states in 1848, and therefore had not yet decided their position on slavery. The map is surrounded by state emblems, emphasizing the tenuous balance between states which did and did not maintain slavery as an active practice.

Discussions of slavery often focus on the south, including in [this famous map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:w9505r836) of enslaved populations in southern states. Even in states without people enslaved, lots of wealth came from enslavement. In Massachusetts, for example, although slavery was illegal starting in 1783, the clothing mills still operated based on slave-picked cotton, rum for distilleries came from plantations in the Caribbean, and many more of the goods that were shipped through Boston and made it a wealthy port city were created through slave labor.

The Fifteenth Amendment is one of the amendments to the Constitution made during Reconstruction, after the Civil War and the national abolition of chattel slavery. The Amendment sought to secure voting rights for Black men following their release from enslavement. [This lithograph](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n5781) has a celebratory feel to it, illustrated as it is with famous people of the time who contributed to what was seen as the advancement of African Americans. These include Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, [Martin Dulany, and Hiram Rhodes Revels](https://americanhistory.si.edu/brown/pdf/Unit1/2.Teacher.15th%20Amendment%20Print.pdf).

The news from Canada recently about the bodies of children found at residential schools is -APPROPRIATE ADJECTIVE-, but Canada is not alone in its genocidal practices against Indigenous people in the Americas. The US also had residential schools which functioned as a way to "kill the Indian, save the man" in each child torn from their families and culture and forced to assimilate or suffer the consequences.
