July 4th is Independence Day in the United States, a day commemorating the ratification of the Declaration of Independence of the colonies from Great Britain. Today, we associate the holiday with the nebulous concept of freedom. But who was free on July 4th, 1776? Who is free today? What do we celebrate when we set off fireworks and have cook outs on Independence Day, and what histories are swept under the rug in the process?

Perhaps most obviously, many people in the colonies were still enslaved in 1776. By the Civil War, there were [nearly four million people](https://thomaslegioncherokee.tripod.com/distributionofslavesinunitedstateshistory.html) enslaved in the US. These people did not have the rights of American citizens in spite of living here, and in mnay cases being born here. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:xg94j2112) drawn after the Mexican-American War shows free and slave states as well as territories that had yet to be carved into states in 1848, and therefore had not yet decided their position on slavery. The map is surrounded by state emblems, emphasizing the tenuous balance between states which did and did not maintain slavery as an active practice.

Even in states without people enslaved, lots of wealth came from enslavement. In Massachusetts, for example, although slavery was illegal starting in 1783, the clothing mills still operated based on slave-picked cotton, rum for distilleries came from plantations in the Caribbean, and many more of the goods that were shipped through Boston and made it a wealthy port city were created through slave labor.
