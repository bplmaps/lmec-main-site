> On May 12, we hosted [From The Vault: Bird's Eye Views](https://www.leventhalmap.org/event/from-the-vault-collections-showing-bird-s-eye-views/)! From The Vault is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Map Center staff. For this edition the series, we looked at objects that map spaces and places from above

#### Geo. H. Walker & Co.

Over 100 objects from our collections, including the two maps shown here, were produced by a Boston-based firm called the Geo. H. Walker & Co. The lithographic firm operated from 1882 to 1927 and produced things like maps, views, portraits, sheet music, and book illustrations.

This map of trolley routes across New England was published in 1905 by the New England Street Railway Club, an early-twentieth century trade association for railway operators and engineers based right here in Boston at 12 Pearl Street. It “contains valuable information for travelers by trolley” like distance, fare, and travel time, and could be purchased for ten cents at “all news stands” or by writing to the Trolley Information Bureau.
