> On May 12, we hosted *[From The Vault: Bird's Eye Views](https://www.leventhalmap.org/event/from-the-vault-collections-showing-bird-s-eye-views/)*! *From The Vault* is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Map Center staff. For this edition the series, we looked at objects that map spaces and places from above

[Bird’s eye views](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\&q=bird%27s+eye) are a unique genre of cartographic materials that were drawn as if the artist viewed a town from an elevated or bird’s eye view perspective. They were compiled and published primarily in North America during the last half of the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century. Artists artists did not actually view their subjects from an elevated perspective, but walked the streets sketching individual buildings. Then they prepared a composite drawing depicting the town to its best promotional advantage.

#### *Birds eye view of Casco Bay, Portland, Maine, and surroundings* (1906)

Over 100 objects from our collections, including this [map of Casco Bay](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:r494vs43c), were produced by a Boston-based firm called the Geo. H. Walker & Co. The lithographic firm operated from 1882 to 1927 and produced things like maps, views, portraits, sheet music, and book illustrations.

#### *Bird’s eye view of trolley routes in New England* (1905)

This [map of trolley routes](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:jh343z12j) across New England was published in 1905 by the New England Street Railway Club, an early-twentieth century trade association for railway operators and engineers based right here in Boston at 12 Pearl Street. It “contains valuable information for travelers by trolley” like distance, fare, and travel time, and could be purchased for ten cents at “all news stands” or by writing to the Trolley Information Bureau.
