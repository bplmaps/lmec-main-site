June is Pride month for LGBT+ people, and the BPL has been celebrating. If you've been to the Central Library at Copley, which is now open to visitors, you've seen the large beautiful rainbow flags waving away in the wind. We don't have flags at the Map Center, but we do have maps full of rainbows! Check out this handful of rainbow-y maps for some celebratory summer fun.

We'll start with [this](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463862d) pictorial map of the world on the Mercator projection by Ernest Dudley Chase. It features people and animals around the world, from polar bears in the north to penguins in the south, and includes several map monsters in the ocean as well as a beautifully detailed Chinese dragon. The rainbow in this map is in Greenland, and is perhaps supposed to mimic the colors of the Northern Lights!

Another of Chase's pictorial Mercator maps has a rainbow on it as well. This map is about the history of transportation and communication, highlighting histories of movement from Jonah's swallowing by a whale to the modern (in 1944) age of aviation.
