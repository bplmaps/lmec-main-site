> *On July 3, we hosted **From The Vault — We Are One: Mapping America’s Road from Revolution to Independence.***

**We bought back the best elements of one of our most popular exhibitions, *[We Are One: Mapping America’s Road from Revolution to Independence](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/3)*, to celebrate this Independence Day.**

*We Are One* maps the American road to independence and explores the tumultuous events that led thirteen colonies to join to forge a new nation. Using geographic and cartographic perspectives, the *From the Vault* traces the American story from the strife of the French and Indian War to the creation of a new national government and the founding of Washington, D.C. as its home.

#### Georg Balthasar Probst, *[London](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463988r)* \[1770–1789]

Twenty times the size of colonial Boston, a late 1700s London led the world in commercial trade, manufacturing, and finance. The River Thames flows through the city center. Ships brought commercial goods from around the world, including tobacco, rice, indigo and cotton from America. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463988r) depicts the city as a place of wonder, as conveyed in this engraving published by a printer from Augsburg, Germany. It was translated into English and Latin for an international audience. The focal point is St. Paul’s Cathedral, designed by Christopher Wren and built in 1711. The legend identifies 70 prominent buildings and landmarks, including the Royal Exchange, where colonial merchants regularly met to conduct business.

#### Nicholas Scull, George Heap, and William Faden, [A plan of the city and environs of Philadelphia](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82m2470) (1777)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82m2488/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

William Faden, geographer to King George III, published [this map of Philadelphia](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82m2470) in March 1777. This map, or one of the earlier versions created by Nicholas Scull and George Heap, may have helped British troops when they occupied the city from September 1777 to June 1778. The map includes a city plan, labels the owners of properties in the surrounding area, and notes fortifications. Instead of a decorative cartouche, the map features an elevation of the Pennsylvania State House. Now known as Independence Hall, the building was famous even then as the site of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

#### Samuel Holland, [A plan of the island of St. John with the divisions of the counties, parishes, & the lots as granted by government, likewise the soundings round the coast and harbours](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6t053n77m) (1775)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:6t053n78w/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Following the French and Indian War, Samuel Holland conducted surveys for many of the charts of Britain’s new North American colonies published in the landmark maritime atlas The Atlantic Neptune. His first task for this project was [a survey of St. John’s Island](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6t053n77m) (modern-day Prince Edward Island). With explicit instructions from the Board of Trade, Holland divided the island into a grid-system of counties, parishes, and townships of uniform size. French and indigenous place names were changed to commemorate British royal figures. The shift to British names expressed the empire’s political control of the region and Holland’s loyalty to his patrons.

#### David W. McCord, *[History 2](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4637669)* (1914)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463767k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Progressive 19th century educators such as Emma Willard and William Channing Woodbridge emphasized the importance of teaching history and geography simultaneously. This practice, which continued into the early 20th century, is evident in the notebook of Lincoln High School student David McCord, displayed here. David’s book from his history class in 1914 contains notes with corresponding maps, such as those related to the Roman Empire. Historical maps allowed students to visualize places in the past, as [David’s map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4637669) of the Holy Roman Empire does.

#### Joseph Schedler, *[J. Schedler's relief map of Boston and environs](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161h55p)* (1874)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1v53jx78x/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Three-dimensional relief maps are visual aids that assist schoolchildren in understanding physical terrain. The first relief maps were created in China, and appeared in Europe in the late 18th century. [This map of Boston and vicinity](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161h55p) demonstrates the hilly character of the suburbs and harbor islands.

#### Ellen Fitz, *[Fitz globe](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f8883)* (1879)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633f889c/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Designed for educators to use in the classroom, [this twelve-inch globe](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f8883) was published in Boston by the textbook firm of Ginn and Heath. The mounting system of vertical rings was patented by Ellen Fitz, a governess from New Brunswick. She was the first woman involved in the design and manufacturing of globes.

The globe's mounting, which was Fitz's unique contribution to this educational tool, was designed to help students understand the effects of the Earth's daily rotation on its axis and yearly revolution around the Sun, with regard to daylight, twilight, and nighttime. By turning the globe's base in relation to the pointer representing the Sun's vertical ray, it is possible to observe these changes through the seasons.

#### Catherine Sargent, *[East Indies from the best authorities](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161c318)* (1791)

Prior to the American Revolutionary War, females received little formal education. However, this changed in the new Republic. Dame schools, run by women in their homes, taught reading, writing and numbers to young children, and needlework to girls. Private female academies, founded in the late 18th century, greatly expanded upon the subjects previously taught to girls. The academies taught not only the basic subjects, but geography, history, and natural science as exhibited in [this hand drawn map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161c318).
