“Fine Art” isn't necessarily a word that comes to the top of one's mind when they think of the city of Boston. Known for being an instrumental part of the nation's founding, as well as being a hub for education and sports, the core tenants and identity of the city may not seem to point towards the arts. The powers in charge of Boston in the 1800s recognized this early on, and foresaw education in the arts as crucial for the evolution and growth of the city. As Boston began to geographically expand after its landfilling was completed in the mid to late 19th century, the city decided to go through somewhat of a rebranding. This led to a focus on educating its citizens about the history and art that made up not only Boston, but the whole world. What better way to do this, than to embark on turning Boston into a bustling hub of the fine arts with the creation of a museum!
