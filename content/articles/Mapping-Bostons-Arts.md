“Fine Art” isn't necessarily a word that comes to the top of one's mind when they think of the city of Boston. Known for being an instrumental part of the nation's founding, as well as being a hub for education and sports, the core tenants and identity of the city may not seem to point towards the arts. The powers in charge of Boston in the 1800s recognized this early on, and foresaw education in the arts as crucial for the evolution and growth of the city. As Boston began to geographically expand after its landfilling was completed in the mid to late 19th century, the city decided to go through somewhat of a rebranding. This led to a focus on educating its citizens about the history and art that made up not only Boston, but the whole world. What better way to do this, than to embark on turning Boston into a bustling hub of the fine arts with the creation of a museum!

In the beginning of the nineteenth century, the city of Boston had very few options for exposing its residents to the arts. Having a personal taste for the fine arts was expensive, let alone hosting a large collection for public view, so Bostonians’ options were limited. [The Boston Athenaeum](https://bostonathenaeum.org/about/#:~:text=Founded%20in%201807%2C%20the%20Boston,Monthly%20Anthology%20and%20Boston%20Review.), founded in 1807 by William Smith Shaw and the Anthology Society as one of the country’s oldest independent libraries, first sought to address this problem. After moving locations a plethora of times and eventually settling into a mansion on Pearl Street, the Athenaeum added an art gallery alongside its massive literary collection in 1827, and began putting on yearly exhibitions of both European and American art. By the time its location on Beacon Hill opened in 1849, where the Athenaeum still resides, a full painting gallery was opened on the third floor where Boston residents could bear witness to masterpieces by great Flemish masters like Peter Paul Rubens or iconic American portraits by Gilbert Stuart.

Around the late 1860s, the demand for more publicly accessible art grew too large to be contained to a singular floor of the Athenaeum, and the great minds behind the city of Boston began to look for a more permanent solution. After about five years of construction, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) opened its doors in Copley Square in 1876. One of the leading intellectuals behind the creation and founding of the Museum of Fine Arts, Charles C. Perkins, was the brother of Edward N. Perkins, the head of the Fine Arts committee at the Boston Athenaeum. This allowed for considerable [collaboration](https://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2013/07/26/athenaeum-and-the-mfa) between the two entities and set the MFA up for success despite its limited financials. Around this time, the Athenaeum also decided to fully commit to its library reputation by abandoning most of its artistic acquisitions, and decided to [donate 56 of its paintings](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/4-609-the-art-museum-history-theory-controversy-spring-2014/dd0f50a42539a84bc742a86190b804d4_MIT4_609S14_assgn_Student_work2.pdf) to the newly established Museum of Fine Arts. This donation, coupled with other gifts from Harvard and MIT, allowed the MFA to find its footing in the early years and persist despite the copious criticism it received.
