It's been a hot few days in New England, and what better way to chill out than with some maps? Here's a selection of cool maps from Junes throughout history!

### Bunker Hill

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463833z/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="Mildred Giddings Burrage. [The attack on Bunker Hill in the peninsula of Charlestown the 17th of June 1775.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463832p) 1926." class="figure-right" >}}

The Battle of Bunker Hill was June 17, 1775. This painting of the battle is done by Maine artist Mildred Burrage, who used gesso to create topography in the map. It's a very beautiful piece with a satisfying texture. We have a lot of battleground maps in our collection, but this is one in particular that rides the line between a piece of art and a map. In fact, we did a whole exhibit on the overlap between art and maps, [which you can still see online](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/23).

### A Swing and a Miss at the Park

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f4632803/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="Egbert Ludovicus Viele. [Plan for the improvement of the Central Park, adopted by the Commissioners, June 3rd, 1856](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463279b). 1856." class="figure-left" >}}

Here's a June 3, 1856 proposed map for improving Central Park! It was created by a cartographer named Viele, who you may or may not know did not end up designing the park. In 1857 there was a contest for the design of Central Park, won by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. Olmsted is famous for designing many parks, including Central Park, Mount Royal Park in Montreal, and the Emerald Necklace in Boston.

### 20th Century Real Estate

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463831d/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="National Association of Real Estate Boards, and R.R. Donnelley and Sons Company. [19th annual convention of the National Association of Real Estate Boards](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4638304). 1926." class="figure-right" >}}

In June 1926 in Tulsa, there was a real estate conference for which this celebratory map was drawn up. It's a stylistically striking piece in primary colors, memorializing the nineteenth annual convention of the National Association of Real Estate Boards. While this map is gorgeous, and has pictures of realtors with funny geographic quips, it also conveys underlying racial attitudes of the time: the only Black person on the whole map is a caricature picking cotton, and there's a Native American used as decoration to highlight Tulsa's western, cowboys-and-Indians charm.

### Swimming with the Fishes

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0z709748t/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="United States. Office of Strategic Services. Geography Division. [Japanese fishing, areas and seasons](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0z709747j). 1942." class="figure-left" >}}

From June 22, 1942 comes this map of seasonal fishing in Japan. It was produced by the Office of Strategic Services, WWII predecessor to the CIA. We have [several maps made by the OSS](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?f%5Bname_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=United+States.+Office+of+Strategic+Services.+Geography+Division) in our collections, including a [mineral resource map of Morocco](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht250c05q), [German freight traffic movement](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht250791z), and [land use in Korea](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht250b81b).
