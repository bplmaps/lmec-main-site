The maps in our featured exhibition, [_Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/), tell stories that are ultimately about people. You’ll see maps covered with the names of businesses, homeowners, and institutions, all of which show places built, inhabited, maintained, and enjoyed by people. However, the stories of some people are harder to find than others. In the case of Boston’s Black community, the urban atlases don’t always tell us as much as we might want to know. For example, the names of building owners are shown on the maps, but not those of renters. For various reasons, including racism, most Black Bostonians of the time did not own their own homes. However, they lived and worked throughout the city even though we may not see their names.

To illuminate the lives and stories that sometimes run hidden through these maps, we follow the biography of an important Black Bostonian who lived in the time period depicted in _Building Blocks_. She worked, studied, played, and created within the landscapes on display.

#### Meet Florida Ruffin Ridley 

Florida Ruffin Ridley was born in 1861. She lived with her parents, George and Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, on Charles Street at the foot of Beacon Hill. Her father was the first African-American to graduate from Harvard Law School and the first Black judge in the United States. Her mother was a well-known activist, writer, and organizer for suffrage and against racial injustice. Florida’s childhood was one of privilege. The family attended the African Methodist Episcopal Church and socialized with many other families in Boston’s elite Black community.

Florida attended public schools in Boston and later returned to the school district as a teacher. Growing up, she was influenced by the older people in her life who had fought for the abolition of slavery and continued to write letters and articles, give speeches and organize meetings to address the injustices they saw against African Americans and women. When she grew up, she took up much of this work herself. 

> Below, we follow Florida's story and see how her life intersected with many other people and places in Boston and beyond.

##### Growing Up 

Florida grew up on the North side of Boston’s Beacon Hill. Her parents were financially well-to-do and highly educated, and so her early years were not representative of those of all Black children in the city. She attended the Grant School near her home, the same school where she would teach after receiving her credentials from the Boston Teachers College as a young woman. Though Boston schools were integrated, the Black population of the city at the time was around 5%, compared with today’s approximately 20%. As a result, there were proportionally few Black students in classrooms.

##### Creating Community 

Florida is probably best known for her participation in the Black women’s club movement. As a founding member of the **Women’s Era Club**, a Boston-based club started in 1894 by her mother, and later a member of the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs (NACWC), Florida wrote and organized around issues of the day—from promoting the arts to women’s suffrage. The club movement created a national community of women committed to promoting the well-being of Black people, with a particular emphasis on Black women. The motto of the NACWC was “[Lifting as We Climb](https://bostonpubliclibrary.sharepoint.com/:i:/s/LeventhalMap/EYzgCndxYEJDl57GnE4FxSQBBJOrNo5JpueoDu_6-tBdcQ?e=5v6g4A)” to convey its dedication to racial uplift.

> _Women’s clubs are helping to bring us to a recognition of the truth that true dignity does not need barriers in order to preserve itself; that snobbishness is a vice, and that while friendship should be bound by congeniality, neighborliness should know no bounds. The club means the spirit of neighborliness with the world, the recognition of our duty toward our neighbor, and not only of our common humanity but our common divinity; the club helps us not only to make the best of that within us but to see the best of that in others. — Florida Ruffin Ridley, Women’s Era, Oct-Nov, 1896_
