> On April 26, we hosted From The Vault: Maps as Art! \
> \
> From The Vault is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. Panoramic maps, also known as bird’s eye view maps, were a popular cartographic form used primarily by U.S. cities and towns during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Although not generally drawn to scale like a more “traditional” map, they show street patterns, individual buildings, and major landscape features from a raised perspective - resembling what a bird might see if it was flying over the area.

##### Belle Hornblower [Back Bay view of the world](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0c486g26b) (2017)

Illustrating the world at the top of Back Bay, the artist brings a different view to visitors’ experience. The bottom half of this picture is an aerial view of Back Bay, with the lines drawn freely using a ballpoint pen, and the colors added using water-soluble colored pencils. It makes me feel a sense of childlike wonder and imagination within this artistically rendered map. At the upper edge of the image, you can even see the Eiffel Tower and the famous Russian Orthodox Church!

##### Belle Hornblower [View of SoWa food trucks](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:zc77wm025) (2016)

Portraying the world at the top of SoWa food trucks, this map was done by the same artist as the Back Bay map as shown during this event. What distinguishes this map from the one of Back Bay  is the apparent use of “sticker art” technique. Many little figures seem to have been cut out from other comic books and pasted onto the map, creating an effect similar to the original medium. Again, it's a map full of color and childlike wonder.

##### Belle Hornblower [Jamaica Plain view of the world](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:c534jj47j) (2020)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:t148jb99w/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Seeing the world at the top of Jamaica Plain, the artist brings a different view to visitors. In this art peace, unlike the previous maps with towering buildings and exaggerated perspective lines, this map appears less abstract. Additionally, the colors are relatively soft and muted. Continuing with the same artistic style as the previous maps by this artist, you can even see Tokyo and Canada at the top of the map.

##### Raúl the Third & Elaine Bay [Boston kids count](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rr173g25m) (2020)

Map as art; art is a way for children to communicate. Innocent and romantic character images, along with vivid color blocks, form unique maps. The cartoons expressed in an artful and playful manner can engage children's attention and make them patient enough to explore different maps.

##### New York : Harper & Brothers, [Pictorial map of the city of Paris and its environs, showing the principal buildings, monuments, parks etc., the French fortifications, and the Prussian lines of investment](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s1619235) (1871)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161924f/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Depicting the Siege of Paris, which took part during the Franco-Prussian War, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s1619235) was created shortly after the French surrendered the city. Lead by the Germans, the siege lasted more than four months and cut off from supplies from the countryside, leading the Parisians to eventually begin eating dogs, cats, and even most of the animals in the Paris zoo by the siege’s end. Included in Harper’s Weekly, an American general interest magazine, the American public would have been incredibly interested in seeing what the landscape of Paris looked like during the war.

##### H. Geissler, [Martel's New York Central Park : respectfully dedicated to the park commissioners](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp760) (1864)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fp778/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

In[ this birds-eye view](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp760) of the park, the viewer observes from the junction of 59th St. and 5th Ave.  Printed six years after work on the park began, it would undergo another 12 years of construction before its completion in 1876. Its previous location in view, Seneca Village was a middle-class settlement of freed African Americans (the first of its kind in the city) that was forcibly seized by the City of New York in order to create Central Park. Though magnificent in its scope even a third of the way through it’s construction, it’s necessary to remember what it took to build the park and who was mandated to provide it.
