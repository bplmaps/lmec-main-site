Every month, I take a close look at the maps that pop up in a search of that month's name! For May, we've got a good selection of historical maps from over the centuries, from the 18th through the 20th.

### Beyond the Blew-hills

This map is of a portion of Stoughton that was formerly Dorchester. It's an 1895 copy of a much earlier, May 8th, 1730 map originally by James Blake (no, not that James Blake). The plot has a lot of text on it explaining how the lots on it are numbered and how to use it. It's also littered with compass roses showing that the map is oriented with south at the top.

### We Love May

Here's a quarter of a map we have of the Cape Verdean Islands from 1747. This view shows Maio, one of the Sotavento Islands. The map is oriented to show a harbor on the northwest side of the island rather than a top-down view of the island. Maio is actually a roughly oval-shaped, not crescent-shaped.

### Lost Lands

Here's a manuscript map of lands "ceded" by the Cherokee to South Carolina in May of 1777. Cession is a loaded term in American history. From our [America Transformed]() exhibit: 

> “Cede” is a very gentle term to describe a deeply violent, forced, and uneasy process. As Native groups suffered losses from epidemics and the destruction of their food sources, they relinquished their lands to the U.S. government, often as a final resort. Native groups were forced to relocate from their homelands, either by treaty or executive orders promising them abundant resources in exchange for territory – none of which were fully realized.

### Great Fires

Two fires took place in Quebec City a month apart from each other in 1845: one on May 28th, and the next on June 28th. The black area shows the burned district from May, and the lighter shading is what burned in June. [These fires killed at least 23 people and left at least 15,000 homeless](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fire-disasters). Like several other of the maps in this set, north is not oriented towards the top of the map. Instead, it is in the lower right corner.
