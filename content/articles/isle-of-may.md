Every month, I take a close look at the maps that pop up in a search of that month's name! For May, we've got a good selection of historical maps from over the centuries, from the 18th through the 20th.

### Beyond the Blew-hills

This map is of a portion of Stoughton that was formerly Dorchester. It's an 1895 copy of a much earlier, 1730 map originally by James Blake (no, not that James Blake). The plot has a lot of text on it explaining how the lots on it are numbered and how to use it. It's also littered with compass roses showing that the map is oriented with south at the top.
