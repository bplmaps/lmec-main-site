**Julia, we’re so excited to have you on board here at the Leventhal Map & Education Center. Tell us a little bit about your background—what led up to your new role with us?**

My academic background is in history and anthropology, but my practical background is more than a decade of classroom teaching and curriculum development in Boston (K-12 and at Northeastern University), and museum education research at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. I’m currently a PhD candidate in history at Northeastern, and I just wrapped up work on a major study at the Gardener. So I wear a lot of hats! 

Tell us a little bit about your dissertation!

I am examining the history of segregated schooling in Boston since the 1970s, and using the neighborhood of East Boston as a case study that will (I hope!) provide a more inclusive framework for considering race and segregation in urban and educational spaces.

Do you have a favorite of the digital programs and tools we have available to the public right now?

I LOVE [the Atlascope tool](https://www.atlascope.org/)! I use it all the time with my undergraduates at Northeastern and in my own research. Every city needs to have one.

What is your earliest memory of maps?

I grew up in the Los Angeles area, and I remember my parents pulling out a Thomas Guide of SoCal every time we needed to go someplace we didn’t know.  We’d get a new edition every few years that reflected the pretty much constant development in the area — even new freeways! So that’s how I learned to navigate, and it’s taken a long time for me to get comfortable with GPS directions rather than planning my driving route out on a Thomas Guide or some other kind of map.

You’re starting in the middle of the short run of Heaven & Earth: The Blue Maps of China. In your opinion, what’s a “must see item” in the exhibit?

That Prussian blue is so captivating!  Both the folding geographical map from 1818 and the celestial map are beautiful informational objects — though for me they are art objects, since I can’t read any of the text! This exhibit provides a nice reminder of how maps as pieces of material culture can function in a multitude of ways.

What work at the Center are you looking forward to?

I love developing high quality, accessible, and engaging materials for teaching and learning with maps and other primary sources. I am most excited about learning more about the collections so that I can help educators and students bring these historical objects into conversation with contemporary questions and ideas.

Do you have a favorite map that you’ve found in the collections yet?

So far, I am completely in love with the 1775 British scrimshaw map of Boston on a powder horn — but ask me again each week and I bet I’ll have a new favorite every time!
