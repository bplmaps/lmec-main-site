> On May 17, we hosted From The Vault: Maps as Art! \
> \
> From The Vault is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. This week, lucky visitors were able to view a special selection of celestial maps, partially inspired by the lovely celestial map featured in Heaven & Earth: The Blue Maps of China, our newest exhibit. With the help of these maps, visitors could stargaze with generations of cartographers from around the world and across centuries and cultures.

##### [Xingye dingxiang fang yangzhitu](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:k356cn73g) (ca. 1730–1770)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:mg74t4234/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

This map from the MacLean collection reminds us of the importance of the “heavens” for maritime navigation. This map is divided into 12 sections. Each section is labeled with the directions of the Chinese compass, constellations associated with each direction, and names of ports accessible in that direction. 

##### William Crosswell [A Mercator map of the starry heavens, comprehending the whole equinoctial, and terminated by the polar circles](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:8049g906v) (1810)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:8049g9074/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

In the lower left corner of this map, you will notice a sculpture bust of a bearded man with a large feather in his cap. The cartographer, William Croswell, attempted through this map and other efforts to refer to a grouping of stars of the Reticulum (a fainter constellation) as the Marmor Sculptile or the “Bust of Columbus”. Unfortunately, this did not catch on.

##### Matthaeus Seutter [Tabula anemographica seu pyxis nautica vulgo compass charte : quâ ventorum noia septem linguis græca scil. latina, italica, hispanica, gallica, hollandica et germanica repræsentantur succinctè elaborata](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n4059) (1740)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:q524n406k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Thirty-two wind heads appear on this 1760 chart of the heavens by German mapmaker Matthaeus Seutter. Corresponding with each of the thirty-two points on the compass, these winds range in age from young to old, with the largest wind heads representing the four principal winds Boreas (North), Eurus (East), Notus (South) and Zephyrus (West). Figures representing the four seasons appear in each corner of the map, and their placement near the four groups of winds symbolizes the weather and natural phenomena each wind was said to bring.

##### John Speed [A new and accurat map of the world : drawne according to ye truest descriptions latest discoveries & best observations yt have beene made by English or strangers, 1651](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82m4332) (1652)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82m434b/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This is a “new and accurat map of the world” from 1651. Beyond the earth, the cartographer has included in the upper right hand corner the ‘Heavens and Elements’ organized in concentric centers with the earth at the center. Radiating out from the earth is the air, fire, the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Leo, the Christian and finally, the first moveable heaven. 


The first moveable heaven, or the primum mobile, was understood through the Renaissance as the outermost part of the universe where the stars and planets were fixed. 

##### Frans Hogenburg [Magnifica illa civitas Verona ; Colonia augusta Verona nova gallieniana](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n390w) (1582)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:q524nh83z/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

The 1582 map illustrates Verona, known as a center for art and architecture, in two views, complete with vignettes on the left, and the Arena – a remnant from the city's importance in Roman times – on the right. Though produced before the play had even been in the drafts, the story of Romeo and Juliet was set in Verona, which would have looked near exactly the same as depicted here.

##### S. Orozco [Acapulco, México](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c42v) (1980)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fn107c434/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Feel the heat and enthusiasm of Acapulco, Mexico through this colorful map. The golden beach, blue sea, and red sailboats evoke thoughts of summer. You can just imagine enjoying the sea breeze and waves and experiencing the charm of Mexico.

##### Ignatz Sahula [19th annual convention of the National Association of Real Estate Boards : at Tulsa, June 7 to June 11 in 1926](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4638304) (1926)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463831d/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

This map was created for realtors traveling to Tulsa for a national conference, aiming to provide them with visual information about the geographical features and cultural atmosphere of the area. By using bright and vibrant primary colors of red, yellow, and blue, along with interesting cartoon elements, the map presents a summer ambiance and playful characteristics, thereby capturing the audience's attention and enhancing visual impact.

##### Miguel Covarrubias [Art forms of the Pacific area](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm08f) (1940)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fm09q/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

In this map, art is the media that connects the whole world - depicting the details of art forms from across the pacific area. through this, we can recognize the diversity of art and culture worldwide. Within this diversity, we may also observe similarities amongst the artworks or resonate with various aspects of them.
