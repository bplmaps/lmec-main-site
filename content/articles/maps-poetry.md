**April is National Poetry Month!** You may not immediately put maps and poems in the same category, but both are mediums rich with meaning. There are [many](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/04/14/map), [many](https://sharonbryanpoet.com/2017/10/10/here-is-a-map-of-our-country/) [poems](https://poets.org/poem/maps) I love that are about [maps,](https://static01.nyt.com/packages/pdf/books/excerpt-poems-elizabeth-bishop.pdf) [cartography](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-06-19-bk-5888-story.html), or [map-related](https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/cartographer-tries-map-way-zion/) themes – on borders, boundaries, travel, or discovery of new lands and identities.

But what about poems _on_ maps? It just so happens that many of the maps in our collection have poems inscribed on them, in legends, around borders, and hidden away in overlooked corners. We find them primarily on pictorial maps, and the poems are mainly by men from the 20th century literary cannon, but the maps they are on cover a wide geographic range. See below for some fun examples of poems on maps in our collections, which we found with a little digging and some keen eyesight.

**South Africa**

This [colorful map is of the Cape Peninsula](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fn44h) in South Africa. Right in the center of the map {{< popup img-src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:vd66x1175/1608,2372,378,261/full/0/default.jpg" bib-src="" target="blank" >}} we see the lines {{</popup>}} “White as sand of / Muizenberg / Spun before the Gale...” attributed to Rudyard Kipling. This line is from his 1895 poem [_The Flowers._](https://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/kipling/flowers.html) Muizenberg is a beach town in the Western Cape – Kipling spent time in South Africa and Cape Town, and this poem is consistent with his theme of writing works about the British Empire and colonial rule.

**London**

This [pictorial map of London](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fn348) was originally published in 1914 as an advertising poster for the London Underground. The design became very popular with the public and was published in several different editions. It is [credited with reviving Tube travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderground_Map) as well as inspiring “Wonderland” maps in other cities, and influencing pictorial mapmaking in the twentieth century.

At the very top of this map, you can {{< popup img-src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fn35j/2825,751,472,434/full/0/default.jpg" bib-src="" target="blank" >}} find several stanzas {{</popup>}} from the famous poem “[The Tyger](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43687/the-tyger)” by William Blake. This map also contains several excerpts from children's books and nursery rhymes, as well as puns about different places (“Men hurl hams in Hurlingham”) – how many can you spot?!

**New York City**

It’s not surprising that this [pictorial map of New York City](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463826j) contains at least one poem, since it’s published by the Washington Square Bookshop.

Not only does it contain a unique poem wrapping around the border of the map ("Here is a map to give you pleasure / a town reduced to your mantel's measure / city of gayety, city of gold / your Bagdad on Hudson, three hundred years old"), it also {{< popup img-src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463827t/3997,1209,1484,997/full/0/default.jpg" bib-src="" target="blank" >}} contains the entirety {{</popup>}} of the (very short) poem “[Parting at Morning](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43772/parting-at-morning)” by Robert Browning, an English poet of the Victorian period. The map also displays excerpts from children’s books, verses from songs, and other funny lines – zoom in here.

**Portland, Maine**

Here’s one for our friends up at the [Osher Map Library](https://oshermaps.org/) in Portland, Maine. _“Often I think of the beautiful town / that is seated by the sea...”_ This stanza about a town by the sea {{< popup img-src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:c534j573w/3792,2832,679,654/full/0/default.jpg" bib-src="" target="blank" >}} appears on {{</popup>}} a [1928 map of Portland, Maine](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:p841c3807). The line is from the poem “[My Lost Youth](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44640/my-lost-youth)” by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who spent his childhood in Portland– he was born there in 1807, when it was still a part of Massachusetts!

**Cape Cod, Massachusetts**

Finally, as we look towards summer weather and weekend beach days, here’s an {{< popup img-src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:jh343z22s/467,4004,1041,552/full/0/default.jpg" bib-src="" target="blank" >}} original poem {{</popup>}} featured on [this delightful 1940 pictorial map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:jh343z21h) of Cape Cod. It’s presumably written by the creator of the map, illustrator Paul Paige of East Brewster, and reads:

> _If you have ever been there, this map is meant for you_  
> _To help recall some happy days beside the ocean blue;_  
> _Or you can send it to a friend, that they perhaps may see,_  
> _Why people love good old Cape Cod, and go there constantly._
