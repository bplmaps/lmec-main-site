Have you seen our current exhibition, Processing Place?

This exhibit focuses on the history of cartography and digital mapping, exploring how computers and cartographers influenced one another and how digital mapping and its evolution impacts our modern age.

The exhibition would not have been possible without the knowledge and collections of David J. Weaver, man of many interests – a map collector, cartographer, geographic information systems (GIS) practioner, and longtime friend of the Leventhal Center who sadly passed away this past August. He was curious, kind, and adventurous – he and his wife even sailed across the Atlantic! His map collection, the “David Judkins Weaver Papers”, are currently housed in Leventhal Center collections.

David knew that he wanted to contribute to future research into the history and practice of geospatial technologies. To accomplish this, the Leventhal Center worked with David and his family to establish the David J. Weaver GIS Research Fund (link to donate page), or “Weaver Fund,” dedicated to supporting groundbreaking research into the history and future of computer mapping.

The Weaver Fund has two main goals:

First, to document history of GIS development, both via Weaver’s collections at the Leventhal Center, and through connecting these collections with other important stories and materials outside of the BPL. Processing Place is just the beginning of what we hope to accomplish in this documentation.

Second, to help us build for the future of computer cartography collections by continuing to drive collections development. This will be done through publication of original GIS research in the form of public scholarship, notably through a research award starting in 2026 (link to page), made possible thanks to the Weaver Fund. Read more about the research award here.

A generous friend of LMEC has promised to match every gift we receive toward the Weaver Fund, up to $5,000, for the month of February. By donating to this fund, you would be helping us continue to advance GIS scholarship and documentation, remaining steadfast in our mission to make maps and geography more publicly accessible and contribute to a deeper understanding of our modern lives.

Please consider making a donation to support this work – every dollar we receive will be committed to telling the ongoing story of how computers and cartographers redraw our world and help us to conceptualize it.
