We hope you’ve had the opportunity to see our current exhibition, *[Processing Place: How Computers and Cartographers Redrew Our World](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/)*.

It exists thanks to David J. Weaver, a visionary cartographer, map collector, and geographic information systems (GIS) practitioner who passed away in August 2024. Before his passing, David saw that the Leventhal Center could become one of the leading institutions working on the history and future of computer cartography, and he had the foresight to establish a fund to support that work. **From now until March 2025, we have a rare opportunity to [double your impact](../../donate/weaver-research-fund) with an anonymous match of gifts up to $2,000 to the David J. Weaver GIS Research Fund**.

David knew that he wanted to contribute to future research into the history and practice of geospatial technologies. His donations of map collections to the Leventhal Center have already set that process in motion, and many of these collections are on display in *Processing Place*. Visitors to the LMEC gallery have appreciated the “Wonderful historic maps… and fascinating computer GIS history,” describing *Processing Place* as “FABULOUS!” In January 2025, the curators of *Processing Place* [delivered a talk on the history of computer mapping to the Washington Map Society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXHPar8nGgs)---the first ever WMS talk on the subject---and in April, they will give the annual “Maps and America” lecture at the American Geographical Society Library. **The Weaver Fund will help future researchers bring more stories like this to the public.**

The Weaver Fund has two main goals:

- First, to **document the history of GIS development**, by strengthening our collections in this topic area, and connecting these collections with other important stories and materials outside of the BPL. 
- Second, to help us **tell stories about how computers and cartography impact our everyday lives** through publication of original GIS research in the form of public scholarship, notably through a **research award starting in 2026**.

Today, you have an opportunity to be part of this work, helping us to continue to advance research where the Leventhal Center is truly a national leader. **Until March 31, 2025, a generous friend of the LMEC has promised to match every gift we receive dedicated to the Weaver Fund, up to a total of $2,000.** Please [consider making a donation today](../../donate/weaver-research-fund). These resources will go to work immediately in support of telling the ongoing story of how computers and cartographers redrew, and continue to redraw, our world.

### Through March 31, 2025, all gifts to the Weaver Fund are doubled by an anonymous match
