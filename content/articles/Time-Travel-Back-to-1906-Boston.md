Imagine trying to describe today’s life in Boston to someone born in the year 2100. Someone who has never seen anything as primitive as an iPhone, except perhaps alongside adding machines and typewriters in an antiquarian’s collection of technical curiosities. Someone who likely has never driven an automobile, but perhaps relies on boats and canals to get around a city whose streets have been reclaimed by the sea. Pretty challenging. Then think how much simpler the task would be if you could show that future person a video of your daily life.
