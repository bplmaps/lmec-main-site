> This is the ninth in a series of Map Chats commissioned by Richard Pegg, Director and Curator of the [MacLean Collection](https://www.macleancollection.com) in Illinois. This interactive Map Chat compares two maps from the MacLean Collection to examine how the Qing Empire was forced to reconceptualize its depictions of territory, geography, and sovereignty in the wake of the nineteenth-century Opium Wars.
