### What's that smell?

Here's a riddle for you. What has no shape, takes no form, and greatly impacts our experiences of urban space?

Is it sunlight? Noise? Greenhouse gas emissions? Yes, yes, yes: all of these make for excellent answers. They shape how we move through and engage with cities, even though we don't see, feel, or touch them in the same way we might touch the dirt in a park or the bricks on a building.

And sometimes, they can be rather unsavory.

In the late 19th century, a number of areas in Boston had been deemed “nuisances” due to another such ephemeral quality---**odor**---as depicted in this 1878 Board of Health map.

Urban geographers and historians have spilled a good bit of ink documenting the smell of cities. [Andrew Robichaud](https://www.bu.edu/history/profile/andrew-robichaud/), for example, has written about how bad smells impacted property values, public perception, and urban growth in ["animal suburbs"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00961442211018188) like Brighton. In 1874, Brighton had been newly incorporated into the City of Boston, and along with it came the [Brighton Abbatoir](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/#view:share$base:000$overlay:39999059010668$zoom:17.09$center:-7920379.4721955415,5215039.743373809$mode:glass$pos:607)---a slaughterhouse from which ["inexpressibly offensive"](https://www.bpl.org/blogs/post/inexpressibly-offensive-the-brighton-abattoir-part-iii/) smells frequently riled up citizens and the Board of Health.

With that in mind, let's do some sniffing around: what can this map teach us about ecological change, environmental perception, and urban form near the turn of the 20th century? 

### A case of "bad air"

Shading them in red, the 1878 Board of Health map identifies three sources of "offensive odors," including sewer outlets, mud-sewage flats, and places of "offensive trades." The geography of these smells was not merely incidental; Boston was originally located on an island connected to land by a narrow peninsula. Its surrounding salt marshes quickly became a dumping ground for trash, sewage, and toxic industries like tanneries. As residential areas were built on newly-filled neighborhoods in the flats, the “offensive odors”---or, put another way, bad air---of these defiled landscapes became a problem.

You might wonder why the Board of Health was responsible for creating a map of odors. At this time, most American physicians accepted the “miasma theory” of disease, which stated that diseases such as cholera and chlamydia spread through **“bad air.”** For example, [the below map of an 1849 cholera outbreak in Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:8336hc331) accompanied a report that blamed overcrowding and poor ventilation---rather than germs in contaminated water---for the outbreak.

In this case, the {{<popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:8336hc349/2555,3407,1269,1286/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank">}}Fort Hill tenements{{</popup>}} to which many cholera cases were traced were occupied predominantly by Irish immigrants. Since anti-immigration advocates already viewed immigrants as [unsanitary and intemperate](http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/civilwarera/items/show/63), the miasma theory also provided a convenient medical justification---erroneous though it was---for racist attitudes and beliefs.

### From "offensive odors" to "ornamental esplanades"

Less than ten years later, in 1886, that very same mud-sewage flat in the Back Bay area had been completely reimagined. In this map of ["New Boston and Charles River Bay,"](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161d18x) it is depicted as an “ornamental promenade,” resplendent with greenery, “costly buildings,” and well-dressed pedestrians.

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161d196/full/full/0/default.jpg" caption="From our collections, this [1886 map and view](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161d18x) shows recent renovations to the Back Bay area, including \"view as the basin will look\" when remaining work is completed." class="figure-right" >}}

In this map of “New Boston and Charles River Bay,” we can see that what used to be labelled “offensive odors” has been transformed into {{<popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161d196/1514,1156,1396,1044/full/0/default.jpg" class="popupTooltip" target="blank">}}“Back Bay Park.”{{</popup>}} However, Frederick Law Olmsted---the [chief landscape architect on the project](https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/back-bay-fens)---insisted that it not be called a “park,” since the renovation was not for recreational but primarily sanitary purposes.

It's important to remember that these sanitary changes were not "just environmental"---as we discuss in our upcoming exhibition ["More or Less in Common,"](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/), "humans" and "nature" are not easily disentangled. Environmental reforms like the development of the Back Bay Fens were inspired not only by a dawning recognition of human-led ecological challenges, but also by an attempt to regulate the “moral” character of the city. Clean, tidy neighborhoods well-served by sanitary infrastructure were seen as necessities for a bourgeois vision of domestic order. All were of the utmost importance to make Boston, to quote the map, "the most attractive and desirable city on the continent to reside in."
