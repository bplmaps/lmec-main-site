> *On March 21, we hosted **From The Vault | As Little Land As Possible: Maps of the Oceans & Seas.***

###### Though over 70% of the planet’s surface is covered in water…

…few stop to think about how we map this huge segment of the Earth (and how important it is we do so). From detailing the best maritime trade routes to documenting exploratory journeys across the sea, maps of our largest bodies of water can push the boundaries of our understanding of “conventional” map making.

In this From The Vault, take a look at some of our maps featuring as little land as possible and see all that’s left to uncover.

#### Marie Tharp and Bruce C. Heezen, [Physiographic diagram of the western Pacific Ocean](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4730543) (1971)

{{< figure src="https://www.leventhalmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wic_24.jpg" class="" >}}

Oceanographic cartographer and geologist Marie Tharp, along with her research partner Bruce Heezen, created the first map of the entire ocean floor. Early editions of ocean floor mapping – as the example reproduced here – feature an informal sketch style, while later final editions were sophisticated physical maps with color and shading, applied to reveal the dramatic mid-ocean canyons highlighting the continental divisions of the globe. Numbers on [the map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4730543) indicate depth of the ocean floor and elevations of individual undersea mountains. Heezen was credited solely for their work for years, and only later on did Tharp gain her rightful place in the cartographic world.

#### Joseph Frederick Wallet Des Barres, [A view of Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149z72h) (1779)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149z73s/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This Revolutionary War era landscape scene](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149z72h), published with a collection of nautical charts, depicted Boston Harbor as it would have appeared to approaching ships. While not technically a map or chart, coastal and headland views were also considered navigational aids. Such graphic images assisted ship captains in identifying prominent landmarks as they entered the harbor. Clearly visible on Boston’s late 18th-century skyline are numerous church spires and a flag on Beacon Hill.

#### Agnes Sinclair Holbrook, ***[“Nationalities Map No. 1,” from Hull-House Maps and Papers …](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4636086)*** (1895)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463609g/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Designed by Agnes Sinclair Holbrook, a Wellesley College graduate and resident of Chicago’s Hull-House, this thematic map of the neighborhood east of the House illustrates the immigrant population living in the area. A female-based social settlement in Chicago’s Near West Side, Jane Addams founded the settlement house in 1889, offering newcomers childcare as well as classes in English and civics. Hull-House played an important role in social reforms of the late 19th-century, and its residents were responsible for transcribing, interpreting and mapping statistical data for the map displayed here. Part of a set of four, [the map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4636086) is heavily influenced by earlier statistical mapping by Charles Booth’s wage maps of London, first published in 1889. This statistical cartographic presentation foreshadows GIS mapping – using color and statistics to present social facts.

#### Mildred Giddings Burrage, ***[The attack on Bunker Hill in the peninsula of Charlestown the 17th of June 1775](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463832p)*** (1926)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463833z/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Maine-based artist Mildred Burrage created many paintings and drawings throughout her career, which began in the early 20th-century. Burrage studied art in both America and Europe, and created numerous impressionist works while staying in France. In the 1920s, she executed several relief-paintings based on historic maps, prints, engravings and photographs. The gesso relief painting displayed here is similar to a vignette illustrated in Sayer and Bennett’s 1775 map “The Seat of War in New England.” [Here](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463832p) Burrage has enlarged the battle scene, and used a gesso (white paint mixture) build-up to show relief. She added gold leaf to the piece for added decorative flare.

#### Marie Catherine Haussard (engraver), ***[Partie de l'Amérique septent? qui comprend la Nouvelle France ou le Canada](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:w9505s84p)*** (1755)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:w9505s85z/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This hand-colored map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:w9505s84p) of the Canadian north features a cartouche engraved and signed by C. (Catherine) Haussard. Marie Catherine and her sister Elizabeth were 18th-century Parisian engravers who specialized in the creation of cartouches – the decorative and informative label identifying a map, its author and the subject. The sisters were daughters of noted French engraver Jean-Baptiste Haussard, who trained them in the art of engraving. The cartouche shown here incorporates popular 18th-century symbols of North America – pine trees, a beaver, and a Native American canoe.

#### Toy Lasker, ***[New York in Maps: An Instant Guide to Every Place in Town](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C380008)*** (1970)

{{< figure src="https://www.leventhalmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wic_21.jpg" class="" >}}

Toy Lasker was the founder and publisher of Flashmaps, Inc., a company that created thematic maps and guidebooks which focused on topics of interest to residents, tourists and the business community. She produced 3 million maps of various major cities and popular tourist destinations before selling the company to Random House in 1987. Lasker conceived and designed the maps displayed here in 1967, partnering with New York Magazine to create[ this cartographic key](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C380008) to Manhattan art galleries, museums, restaurants, parks, theatres, shops and transportation. These popular maps were used decades ago similar to how smartphones are used today to navigate cities – helping visitors locate their places of interest.

#### Green Map System; Wendy E. Brawer, ***[Powerful Green Map NYC: Charting the Energy in New York’s Environment](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4727385)*** (2006)

{{< figure src="https://www.leventhalmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wic_35.jpg" class="" >}}

The Green Map System based in New York City and founded by Wendy Brawer, has for decades focused on the environment, sustainability and culture, in an effort to create a healthier and greener place to live. Green Map NYC calls on city residents using GIS technology to create maps of their neighborhoods reflecting issues that are important to them. Thematic maps created from statistical data, such as [the energy-use map displayed here](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4727385), help visualize the impact of an urban way of living on the natural environment. Created after the New York City blackout in 2003, this map was intended to raise awareness of energy consumption and conservation.

#### Sarah Bell, ***Denali Peak*** (2022?)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/476390817_18487483150050767_4933809322279444140_n.jpg" class="" >}}

Created by notable modern cartographer, [Sarah Bell](https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/portfolio/), this map depicts Denali, the highest peak in North America at 20,310 feet (6,190 m). It was named by the Koyukon people centuries ago, and means ‘Great One.’ The mountain is popular among climbers and mountaineers and Denali National Park is centered on this great mountain. So far in her career as a cartographer and data visualization specialist, Bell has done work for the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, Western Washington University’s Resilience Institute, as well as a number of private institutions.

#### Meghan Kelly, ***[Current Reservations and Tribal Lands](https://wisconsinfirstnations.org/current-tribal-lands-map-native-nations-facts/)*** (2018)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Current-Tribal-Lands-Map-and-Facts-Poster_PDF.jpg" class="" >}}

Created to orient students to their “Native neighbors” by showcasing the local tribal lands and nations of Wisconsin, [Meghan Kelly](https://meghankelly-cartography.github.io/) designed [this map](https://wisconsinfirstnations.org/current-tribal-lands-map-native-nations-facts/) with the input and partnership from a number of tribal and state organizations. Intended for classroom use, this map gracefully distills vast amounts of tribal history and complex boundaries to a tool everyone from children to adults can navigate. 

Meghan Kelly is the Center’s next [Designer-In-Residence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/designer-in-residence/) and will spend time this June working with the LMEC collections, producing original material in collaboration with Center staff, and working on her own independent creative cartographic projects.
