> *On March 21, we hosted **From The Vault | As Little Land As Possible: Maps of the Oceans & Seas.***

###### Though over 70% of the planet’s surface is covered in water…

…few stop to think about how we map this huge segment of the Earth (and how important it is we do so). From detailing the best maritime trade routes to documenting exploratory journeys across the sea, maps of our largest bodies of water can push the boundaries of our understanding of “conventional” map making.

In this From The Vault, take a look at some of our maps featuring as little land as possible and see all that’s left to uncover.

#### Marie Tharp and Bruce C. Heezen, [Physiographic diagram of the western Pacific Ocean](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4730543) (1971)

{{< figure src="https://www.leventhalmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wic_24.jpg" class="" >}}

Oceanographic cartographer and geologist Marie Tharp, along with her research partner Bruce Heezen, created the first map of the entire ocean floor. Early editions of ocean floor mapping – as the example reproduced here – feature an informal sketch style, while later final editions were sophisticated physical maps with color and shading, applied to reveal the dramatic mid-ocean canyons highlighting the continental divisions of the globe. Numbers on [the map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4730543) indicate depth of the ocean floor and elevations of individual undersea mountains. Heezen was credited solely for their work for years, and only later on did Tharp gain her rightful place in the cartographic world.

#### Joseph Frederick Wallet Des Barres, [A view of Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149z72h) (1779)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149z73s/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This Revolutionary War era landscape scene](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149z72h), published with a collection of nautical charts, depicted Boston Harbor as it would have appeared to approaching ships. While not technically a map or chart, coastal and headland views were also considered navigational aids. Such graphic images assisted ship captains in identifying prominent landmarks as they entered the harbor. Clearly visible on Boston’s late 18th-century skyline are numerous church spires and a flag on Beacon Hill.

#### Georges-Louis Le Rouge, [Remarques sur la navigation de terre-neuve à New-York afin d'eviter les courrants et les bas-fonds au sud de Nantuckett et du Banc de George](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82m308h) (1785)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82m309s/1081,462,3110,2734/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

One of the preferred routes that captains and navigators sailing from America to England learned to use was the Gulf Stream, a strong, warm current that flows north along the Atlantic coast and then east toward Europe. Initially charted by Benjamin Franklin in 1768, this discovery helped ships minimize travel time across the ocean, speeding up the transatlantic voyage for travelers, merchants, and goods. Franklin purchased [this 1785 chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82m308h), a French adaptation of his original findings, when he served in Paris as a diplomat for the United States during the early years of the republic.

#### Matthew Fontaine Maury, [Whale Chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f952x) (1851)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633f9536/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

The importance of the mid-19th-century American whaling industry, which was dominated by ports in southern New England, especially New Bedford, Massachusetts, is documented by this innovative thematic map. It was prepared by Matthew Fontaine Maury, an American naval officer and oceanographer who served as the Superintendent of the U.S. Navy Depot of Charts and Instruments (later the U.S. Naval Observatory) from 1842 to 1861. Because of his contributions to oceanography including a series of wind and current charts for the world oceans, Maury is often recognized as the father of the science of oceanography. 

By centering [the map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f952x) on the Pacific Ocean, however, Maury showed that the primary habitat of whales was the Pacific arena rather than the Atlantic, where the whale resources had been terribly depleted. Interestingly, the sperm whale distribution was heavily concentrated in the central Pacific. This includes the area between Hawaii and the California coast, appearing just to the right of the map's center, where New England whalers focused their efforts. Seasonal variations were indicated by the letters w (winter), v (spring), s (summer), a (autumn), and all (all months).

#### H.H. Lloyd, [Telegraph chart ](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149w21m) (1858)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149w22w/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149w21m) shows the track of the great submarine Atlantic telegraph in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Europe, and north Africa, as well as submarine cables, steamship routes, and proposed lines to be added at a later date. Included to accompany the chart are two double column articles of text: one accounts the invention and operation of the magnetic telegraph and the other is a description of the making and laying submarine telegraph cables. The laying of the Atlantic cable was one of the great international undertakings of the nineteenth century and would take the equivalent of billions of dollars, four failed attempts, and another 8 years after this map was published before it was completed.

#### Toy Lasker, ***[New York in Maps: An Instant Guide to Every Place in Town](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C380008)*** (1970)

{{< figure src="https://www.leventhalmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wic_21.jpg" class="" >}}

Toy Lasker was the founder and publisher of Flashmaps, Inc., a company that created thematic maps and guidebooks which focused on topics of interest to residents, tourists and the business community. She produced 3 million maps of various major cities and popular tourist destinations before selling the company to Random House in 1987. Lasker conceived and designed the maps displayed here in 1967, partnering with New York Magazine to create[ this cartographic key](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C380008) to Manhattan art galleries, museums, restaurants, parks, theatres, shops and transportation. These popular maps were used decades ago similar to how smartphones are used today to navigate cities – helping visitors locate their places of interest.

#### Green Map System; Wendy E. Brawer, ***[Powerful Green Map NYC: Charting the Energy in New York’s Environment](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4727385)*** (2006)

{{< figure src="https://www.leventhalmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wic_35.jpg" class="" >}}

The Green Map System based in New York City and founded by Wendy Brawer, has for decades focused on the environment, sustainability and culture, in an effort to create a healthier and greener place to live. Green Map NYC calls on city residents using GIS technology to create maps of their neighborhoods reflecting issues that are important to them. Thematic maps created from statistical data, such as [the energy-use map displayed here](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C4727385), help visualize the impact of an urban way of living on the natural environment. Created after the New York City blackout in 2003, this map was intended to raise awareness of energy consumption and conservation.

#### Sarah Bell, ***Denali Peak*** (2022?)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/476390817_18487483150050767_4933809322279444140_n.jpg" class="" >}}

Created by notable modern cartographer, [Sarah Bell](https://www.sarahbellmaps.com/portfolio/), this map depicts Denali, the highest peak in North America at 20,310 feet (6,190 m). It was named by the Koyukon people centuries ago, and means ‘Great One.’ The mountain is popular among climbers and mountaineers and Denali National Park is centered on this great mountain. So far in her career as a cartographer and data visualization specialist, Bell has done work for the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, Western Washington University’s Resilience Institute, as well as a number of private institutions.

#### Meghan Kelly, ***[Current Reservations and Tribal Lands](https://wisconsinfirstnations.org/current-tribal-lands-map-native-nations-facts/)*** (2018)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Current-Tribal-Lands-Map-and-Facts-Poster_PDF.jpg" class="" >}}

Created to orient students to their “Native neighbors” by showcasing the local tribal lands and nations of Wisconsin, [Meghan Kelly](https://meghankelly-cartography.github.io/) designed [this map](https://wisconsinfirstnations.org/current-tribal-lands-map-native-nations-facts/) with the input and partnership from a number of tribal and state organizations. Intended for classroom use, this map gracefully distills vast amounts of tribal history and complex boundaries to a tool everyone from children to adults can navigate. 

Meghan Kelly is the Center’s next [Designer-In-Residence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/designer-in-residence/) and will spend time this June working with the LMEC collections, producing original material in collaboration with Center staff, and working on her own independent creative cartographic projects.
