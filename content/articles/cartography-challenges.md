### Cartography Challenges

As part of our ongoing commitment to [supporting researchers and designers](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/fellowships/) who work at the intersection of geography and cartography, we're excited to announce a new initiative at the Map Center: **Cartography Challenges**!

In each [Cartography Challenge](https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/cartography-challenge/), we'll invite mapmakers, cartographers, and designers to submit their work for a chance at $200 in prize money and the opportunity to be featured in our digital collections. The Map Center will provide a dataset, a topic, and a couple of rules; the rest is up to you.

### Inaugural Challenge: "No Choropleth, No Problem"

Our inaugural cartography challenge---["No Choropleth, No Problem"](https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/cartography-challenge/immigration-in-boston/)---asks for a creative visualization of immigration in the Greater Boston area that uses **anything except a choropleth map**.

There are a couple of reasons that we've set up our first Challenge in this way. First, the [most up-to-date ACS 5-year estimates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/news/data-releases/2020/release.html) were released in March of this year. We'd love to see some maps about immigration that draw on this recent data.

Second, most of the modern immigration maps in the [Map Center's digital collections](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?per_page=100&q=immigration) are choropleth maps. This isn't a bad thing, per se, but we're cognizant that choropleth maps aren't perfect. They have a tendency to [generalize areas that shouldn't be generalized](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151983/), and they aren't great at [accounting for density](https://populationeducation.org/limitations-to-choropleth-maps-a-warning-on-misleading-data/). That's why, in this Challenge, we need your help de-choroplething our collections and imagining some other ways of representing immigration in Greater Boston. We want to see maps that move: flow maps, cartograms, dot density, something else entirely.

Submissions are due **December 19, 2022**. Check out the [Cartography Challenges](https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/cartography-challenge/immigration-in-boston/) page to learn more about this initative, including where to download the required data. Don't hesitate to [reach out to us directly](https://leventhalmap.org/about/people/ian-spangler) if you have any questions

Happy mapping!
