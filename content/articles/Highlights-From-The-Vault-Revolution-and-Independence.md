> **On July 5, we hosted *From The Vault: Revolution and Independence!***\
> \
> *From The Vault* is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. In this *From The Vault*, as we enter the 250th year since America’s first fight to gain independence, we had an opportunity to reflect on our nation’s founding and on similar historic events of the past. We were able to examine maps that showcased the peoples, regions, and nations that worked to revolutionize their social structure and gain independence from those that sought to suppress their freedom. With over 130 visitors over the course of the two hour event, this was our most successful From The Vault event yet!

The Haitian Revolution has often been described as the largest and most successful slave rebellion in the Western Hemisphere. Enslaved people initiated the rebellion in 1791 and by 1803 they had succeeded in ending not just slavery but French control over the colony. In the 18th century, Saint Domingue, as Haiti was then known, had become France’s wealthiest overseas colony and generated more revenue for France than all 13 North American colonies for Britain. All of this money was made through agricultural trade through the work of over 500,00 enslaved people, outnumbering White people and freed colored people 10 to 1.

Led by former slave Toussaint l’Overturein 1791, L’Overture was eventually captured and sent to France where he died in prison in 1803. Jean-Jacques Dessalines, formerly enslaved and one of l’Overture’s generals, led the revolutionaries at the Battle of Vertieres on November 18, 1803 where the French forces were defeated. On January 1, 1804, Dessalines declared the nation independent and renamed it Haiti.

##### Pichon [Nouveau plan routier de la ville et faubourgs de Paris avec ses principaux édifices et nouvelles barrières](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:kh04p6588) (1802)

The French Revolution was an event that had worldwide impact and gave many the courage to fight back against oppressive ruling governments. Began in 1789 and ended in the late 1790s with the ascent of Napoleon Bonaparte, French citizens radically altered their political structure. The upheaval was caused by disgust with the French aristocracy and the economic policies of King Louis XVI who had left France incredibly economically unstable. Revolting against years of exploitation, peasants looted and burned the homes of tax collectors, landlords and the aristocratic elite.

This map was created post-war and highlights the important cultural features of the city and showcases the deliberate planning, organization, and expansion of Paris. Depicting the rebuilding of Paris after the French Revolution, you can see the expansion of the city past its old city walls symbolizing a healing and growing nation.

##### Samuel Swett [Sketch of Bunker Hill Battle](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3t947b90p) (1826)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3t947b91z/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" caption="" >}}

This map depicts the Battle of Bunker Hill, known as the first major battle of the American Revolution. The battle took place in Charlestown, just outside of Boston, and was named after the tallest hill in the area, though the majority of the battle took place on Breed’s Hill, located near the center of the map. Lines of fire, British entry points, and a colonist fort are depicted on this map created 50 years after the initial battle.

##### Robert Sayer and John Bennett [The theatre of war in North America, with the roads and a table of the distances](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vs95d) (1776)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:z603vs96p/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

A full and in-depth account of all of the British colonies and their populations in North America. Included with this detailed map are full descriptions of each region, including regional markers, prominent counties and the towns within them, all large lakes, rivers, capes, and bays. Also featured on the center-right of the map is a chart showing how the distance (in British miles) between prominent colonial cities were from each other. A map of this kind would have been incredibly helpful to orient the British military to the new American fight for independence.

##### **Gideon Hawley** *[Plan of Mashpee](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kr37q)* (1785)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82kr380/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

This manuscript survey sketch provides an early example of the treaties between American leaders and native peoples that designated land for their use. Gideon Hawley, a Christian missionary to the Mashpee Indians, drew this reservation map for Reverend Isaac Smith. Like most Native American tribes in Massachusetts, the Mashpee lived on Cape Cod. The Mashpee fought with the Americans during the Revolutionary War and suffered heavy losses. In 1783, Hawley noted that there were at least 70 widows on the Mashpee reservation, most of whom had lost their husbands during the war.

##### **Boston Redevelopment Authority** *[South End urban renewal area R-56](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h14cz068)[ : re-use parcels](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h14cz068)* (1965)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h14cz07j/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

During the 1960s and 1970s, the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) produced hundreds of maps that depicted “urban renewal areas” across the city of Boston. These areas had been identified as targets for reinvestment of federal funds as part of the Housing Act of 1949, which set aside funds for “slum clearance.” This map depicts the BRA’s proposal for urban renewal of various parcels in the South End, including Parcel 19 (listed “P19” on the map). In the late 1960s, the largely Puerto Rican residents of Parcel 19 founded Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción (IBA) in order to prevent displacement from their homes.

***The following photos and materials document some of the tenant movements in the Boston’s South End and Chinatown***, including Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción (IBA), which founded Villa Victoria in the South End, and the tenants of 90 Warrenton Street who fought against evictions in Chinatown. Especially in the 1960s and 1970s, tenants across Boston who were fed up with high prices, poor conditions, and the prospect of displacement began to organize with one another for better housing conditions.
