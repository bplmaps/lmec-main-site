> **On July 5, we hosted *From The Vault: Revolution and Independence!***\
> \
> *From The Vault* is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. In this *From The Vault*, as we enter the 250th year since America’s first fight to gain independence, we had an opportunity to reflect on our nation’s founding and on similar historic events of the past. We were able to examine maps that showcased the peoples, regions, and nations that worked to revolutionize their social structure and gain independence from those that sought to suppress their freedom. With over 130 visitors over the course of the two hour event, this was our most successful From The Vault event yet!

The Haitian Revolution has often been described as the largest and most successful slave rebellion in the Western Hemisphere. Enslaved people initiated the rebellion in 1791 and by 1803 they had succeeded in ending not just slavery but French control over the colony. In the 18th century, Saint Domingue, as Haiti was then known, had become France’s wealthiest overseas colony and generated more revenue for France than all 13 North American colonies for Britain. All of this money was made through agricultural trade through the work of over 500,00 enslaved people, outnumbering White people and freed colored people 10 to 1.

Led by former slave Toussaint l’Overturein 1791, L’Overture was eventually captured and sent to France where he died in prison in 1803. Jean-Jacques Dessalines, formerly enslaved and one of l’Overture’s generals, led the revolutionaries at the Battle of Vertieres on November 18, 1803 where the French forces were defeated. On January 1, 1804, Dessalines declared the nation independent and renamed it Haiti.

With Boston’s rising population and increased demand for housing, the Boston Land Company began to develop former marshland in East Boston in the 1880s, including Hog Island (also called Breed’s Island) which became Orient Heights. This promotional map invites the viewer to imagine themselves in one such newly developed suburb. The invocation to “SECURE A HOME” and “STOP PAYING RENT” may seem like a simple advertisement, but it also serves as a precursor to the “Own Your Own Home” movement that would take off a couple of decades after this map was made. Homeownership would become associated with responsible citizenship, and so-called “transient” renters were considered unscrupulous.

A city’s shared history depends greatly upon its unique architectural styles. In the Greater Boston area, there is perhaps no style more quintessential than the so-called “triple-decker.” In the 1870s, these three-story buildings enjoyed a surge in popularity. By 1920, about 15,000 triple deckers had been constructed. Created by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) in the 1970s, these maps document the distribution of triple decker homes in the City of Boston.

##### **W. E. B. Du Bois** *[The Seventh Ward of Philadelphia : the distribution of Negro inhabitants throughout the ward, and their social conditions](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:gb19h9947)* (1899)

By the end of the 19th century, Philadelphia was home to 40,000 African Americans, comprising the largest population in any northern city. Drawing from the sociological studies by residents of Chicago's Hull House, African American sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois undertook a similar study in Philadelphia, focusing on Ward 7, the location of the city's oldest Black neighborhood. In this community with roughly 9,700 residents, Du Bois and his associates conducted approximately 5,000 interviews. Their findings were published as The Philadelphia Negro (1899), which included this fold-out map with the location of every residence, church, and business owned by Black people.

##### **Gideon Hawley** *[Plan of Mashpee](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kr37q)* (1785)

This manuscript survey sketch provides an early example of the treaties between American leaders and native peoples that designated land for their use. Gideon Hawley, a Christian missionary to the Mashpee Indians, drew this reservation map for Reverend Isaac Smith. Like most Native American tribes in Massachusetts, the Mashpee lived on Cape Cod. The Mashpee fought with the Americans during the Revolutionary War and suffered heavy losses. In 1783, Hawley noted that there were at least 70 widows on the Mashpee reservation, most of whom had lost their husbands during the war.

##### **Boston Redevelopment Authority** *[South End urban renewal area R-56](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h14cz068)[ : re-use parcels](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h14cz068)* (1965)

During the 1960s and 1970s, the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) produced hundreds of maps that depicted “urban renewal areas” across the city of Boston. These areas had been identified as targets for reinvestment of federal funds as part of the Housing Act of 1949, which set aside funds for “slum clearance.” This map depicts the BRA’s proposal for urban renewal of various parcels in the South End, including Parcel 19 (listed “P19” on the map). In the late 1960s, the largely Puerto Rican residents of Parcel 19 founded Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción (IBA) in order to prevent displacement from their homes.

***The following photos and materials document some of the tenant movements in the Boston’s South End and Chinatown***, including Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción (IBA), which founded Villa Victoria in the South End, and the tenants of 90 Warrenton Street who fought against evictions in Chinatown. Especially in the 1960s and 1970s, tenants across Boston who were fed up with high prices, poor conditions, and the prospect of displacement began to organize with one another for better housing conditions.
