> *On August 29, we hosted **From The Vault: Blue(print) Maps**.*\
> \
> During the same time period that printers in China were producing the outstanding “blue maps” of Heaven and Earth currently on display in our [gallery](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/) using a technique involving the pigment Prussian Blue, surveyors and other map makers in the West were producing their own “blue maps.” Based on the blueprint process introduced in the 1840s, these white-on-blue drawings could be produced rapidly and inexpensively while ensuring the longevity and accuracy of a reproduction, which greatly impacted the distribution of visual information.\
> \
> This *From the Vault* featured examples from the Center’s survey collections that demonstrate how blueprints helped influence the changing 19th-century American landscape, from the fill of Boston’s Back Bay to a “celestial map” of Canton, Massachusetts to a railroad project in Texas.\
> \
> *These maps are not a part of our digital collections and the pictures of each object were taken during from the event. We've done our best to accurately portray each item, but for the best viewing experience, please schedule a research visit to the Center to see them in person. *

##### Frederic Endicott ***Plan for Arc Lights. Canton, Mass.*** (1886)

Introduced in the late 1870s, {{<popup img-src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/unnamed.jpg" bib-src="http://www.kbrhorse.net/streetlights/understanding_arc_lamps.html">}}arc lamps{{</popup>}} were the primary technology used for street lighting until incandescent lamps took over in the early 20th century. In 1890, the town of Canton, Massachusetts installed its first set of street lights as a trial; within a few months, the lights were deemed indispensable and residents were demanding even more streets to be illuminated. In 1886, surveyor Frederic Endicott produced plans showing the locations of arc lights along the town’s major roadways. The minimalist presentation and the star-like symbol chosen to represent the lights evoke a celestial map such as those shown in the gallery exhibition, *[Heaven & Earth](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/)*. 

##### Louis Day Map - B. Property at Floral Park. Nassau County, N.Y. The Floral Park Corporation. (1919)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Floral Map.png" class="" >}}

Floral Park in Nassau County, New York is an example of the late 19th-century interest in planned suburban communities, often supported by a conveniently nearby railway station.  Based in a region of flower farms, the community features streets named after plants as well as many amenities. Development commenced in the 1880s and 1890s but additions continued well into the 20th century. Blueprints provided a useful format for the developers and planners to track modifications, lots sales, and other developments on copies of the original; this version shows crosses, probably to mark transactions related to specific lots. 

##### Frederic Endicott Map of Three Mile Island in Lake Winnipesaukee Owned by the Appalachian Mountain Club. Together with its Nearest Neighbors. (1902)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/map 1.png" caption="" >}}

Surveyor Frederic Endicott loved mountaineering and was an active member of the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) where he assumed various roles, including "Councilor of Topography" (the AMC also has his photography collection). In the 1900s, the area around Lake Winnipesaukee was remote and undeveloped; Endicott helped in documenting the transfer of lots on the lake’s Three Mile Island owned by Mrs. Eastman and Mr. Lawrence to the Club. Today, the island is a highly popular resort for camping. 

##### C.R.B.; Edmund S. Davis  Detail Plan. Section 4. Boylston Street Subway. Typical Cross Section. (1913)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/map 1 (1).png" class="" >}}

Since their introduction, blueprints have become synonymous with construction drawings. They are durable enough for use at construction sites, can be drawn on, and easily reproduced and distributed to the many trades involved in a construction project. This detailed plan shows a section elevation view of the subway tunnels at the MBTA Green Line Boylston Street subway station (the section clarifies how tight the space is between the two subway tracks). The creator was Edmund S. Davis, who served as chief engineer of the Boston Transit Department from 1909 through 1920. 

##### Robert B. Bellamy Plan of Property of Society Har Moriah Cemetery Corporation, Hyde Park and West Roxbury Mass (1931)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/map 3.png" >}}

In 1931, Dorchester-based surveyor Robert B. Bellamy produced a survey for the Society Har Moriah Cemetery Corporation. The plan shows multiple lots at the Cemetery’s site at the Hyde Park / West Roxbury border. These two versions of the plan demonstrate the blueprint process – the image on the left is the original drawing, created with dark ink on a translucent paper. The blueprint process produced a reverse image of white lines and text on a blue background. An infinite number of prints could be produced in much less time than hand copying and the prints could be marked up, rolled, and otherwise handled without impacting the original. The prints also were difficult to modify without being obvious so they often served as “record copies.”   

##### Fuller & Whitney Plans Commonwealth and Beacon (1880s)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/map 3 (1).png" class="" >}}

The civil engineering/surveying firm of Fuller & Whitney, later William H. Whitney, oversaw the development and filling-in of Boston’s Back Bay during the 1880s. This work involved the development of overall street layouts, studies of alternative schemes for various neighborhoods, and documentation of land sales. Most of these documents were circulated as blueprints, using a variant on the process invented in 1842 by Sir John Hershel that Whitney modified, earning him an award from the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics' Association. His work in this area helped mainstream blueprints in his profession. 

The treatment of the outlines of bodies of water in Back Bay evokes thoughts of some of the celestial drawings in the current Heaven & Earth exhibit. 

##### Miguel Covarrubias ***[Art forms of the Pacific area](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm08f)*** (1940)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fm09q/full/1600,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

The 1940 lithograph shown here is a pictorial map of the pacific region encompassing Asia, Oceania, and the Americas that highlights the different artistic styles present in each region. It is done in a very lighthearted and cartoonish style and seeks to show off the culture of the land as opposed to just representing the land itself. This particular lithograph is known as an “offset lithograph” as the artist printed it onto another material before printing it onto its final piece of paper. This technique was used frequently so that the artist did not have to worry about drawing the initial design backwards to have it printed the correct way. Lithography as a technique was more commonly used than engraving due to ease, but as mass commercialization of the lithograph began, the quality of the maps produced with it began to decline. Despite advancements in technology since then, it is still commonly used in cartographic practice today.

##### United States Army Signal Corps, A. W. (Adolphus Washington) Greely, and United States War Department ***[Progress map of Signal Corps telegraph lines & cables in the military division of the Philippines](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6q185t494)*** (1900)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:t722mh28p/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="figure-right" >}}

The 1900 map of the Philippines shown here was used as an informational piece by the military to keep track of the different telegraph and cable lines across the country. This map was also created through the lithographic process, though was done using a method called “photolithography” which began the transition from previous analog methods into cartographic methods more heavily shaped by technology. As photography slowly developed and advanced, its application in the process of creating maps became more apparent. 

In photolithography, the same general lithographic techniques are used, though the image that would traditionally be drawn or painted onto the stone block is instead a photo transferred onto its surface. For the creation of photo relief maps, this technique was extremely useful to ensure accurate and precise information was being relayed. Photolithography was commonly used for military maps, and later became more widespread as technology advanced even further. 

##### National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Planetary Geology Program (U.S.). ***[Shaded relief map of the Aeolis quadrangle of Mars](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90k819m)*** (1984)
