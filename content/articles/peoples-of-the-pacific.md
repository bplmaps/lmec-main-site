On April 7, 1949, the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific [opened on Broadway](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/02/rodgers-hammerstein-michener-south-pacific) and became an instant smash hit with a record-breaking five-year run. Songs like _Some Enchanted Evening_, _Bali-Ha’i_, _There Is Nothin’ Like a Dame_, and _I’m Going to Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair_ were on everyone’s lips. On the anniversary of the musical’s opening 72 years later, Broadway is beginning to come back to life after a difficult pandemic year of dark theaters. But recent acts of racist violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders should also make us question how stereotypes of Asian ethnicities have been shaped by images of the “other” in popular culture for many decades.
