> *On February 7, we hosted **From The Vault: For the Love of Maps!***

Maps have so much to offer—from the rich history behind their creation and visual perspectives of familiar places to the depth of information they communicate and so much more. While the staff at the Leventhal Center have a special place in our hearts for all of our maps, there are just a few that each of us love the tiniest bit more than the others.

In this *From The Vault* collections showing, we took a look at the personal favorites of the staff at the Leventhal Center and the multitude of reasons these maps have captured our attention amongst our collection of over 250,000 maps.

#### Newton Horace Winchell, ***[A geological map of the Black Hills](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fb39t)*** (1875)

*Selected by Julia Williams, Gallery and Communications Coordinator*

Portraying the Black Hills (also known as the Six Grandfathers) mountain range of South Dakota and Wyoming, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fb39t) was created in 1875 during a time of major conflict in this region. Just a few years prior in 1868, the US government had signed a treaty “exempting the Black Hills from all non-indigenous settlement forever”. However, when gold was found in the area 6 years later, the US government conquered the Black Hills and forcibly relocated the Lakota people who were indigenous to the area.

50 years later, work began on this landmark on the sacred mountain range and in 1941, Mount Rushmore was opened to the public. Featuring the faces of 4 US presidents to represent the first 150 years of American history, the site now receives more than 2 million visitors a year.

> “This is my (current) favorite map in the collection because it’s so visually stunning with all the different bands of color, but primarily for the history that underlies this location. It reminds me that maps are simply a snapshot of a much larger picture of what’s going on in the world.”

#### William M. Coombs, ***[Map showing the sources of some of the offensive odors perceived in Boston, 1878](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:w3765q66z)*** (1878)

*Selected by Emily Bowe, Assistant Director*

This map from 1878 was made by the Boston Board of Health, at a time when the growing city was confronting issues about waste and public health. In red hatching, you'll see "mud-sewage flats" depicted in once-marshy areas of the city. You may also notice the numbered red dots along the edges of the wharves and land, indicating locations of sewage outlets. The makers of [the map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:w3765q66z) have drawn red arrows indicating the wind direction, which makes it easy to see which parts of the city would have been impacted by "offensive odors." 

> “I love this map because it helps visitors imagine the experience of walking through Boston streets in the late nineteenth century. It was probably pretty smelly to be in the newly-built Back Bay neighborhood, with the prevailing winds bringing smells of "mud-sewage flats" to where you're standing!”

#### Fuller & Whitney, c.e., [Plan of region west of Back Bay Park, Boston, Mass. : proposed improvements](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:t722mh264) (1886)

Selected by Claire Tratnyek, Learning Resource Specialist

[This 1886 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:t722mh264) with overlays of what is now known as the Fenway neighborhood of Boston shows an array of possible configurations for a new neighborhood that would be created entirely anew at the tail-end of the decades-long project of filling in Boston’s Back Bay. Would the streets along Frederick Law Olmsted’s Muddy River Park (then still in progress) be gridded and regular, or would they be sinuous and curving, like the river itself?

#### Nancy Morita, ***[The ecology and natural history of San Francisco wild in the city](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C9000010)*** (1992)

{{< figure src="https://planetdrum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_wild_in_city.jpg" class="" >}}

[This poster-style map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C9000010) compares a view of the natural geography of San Francisco before colonization (1750) with a then present-day (1990s) street map to show what features could be restored to their natural state. The natural side of the map shows the location of the sand dunes, grasslands, wildflower-butterfly hilltops, Ohlone village sites, creek paths, salt marshes, and berry-brushlands that “underlie” the city of San Francisco. 

This map was created, in part, to reintroduce the natural landscape to San Franciscans and help them understand how it continued to influence their lives in the urbanized city 200+ years later. One example is to help explain why some people’s basements flood or buildings sink. This map was also attempting to help city dwellers connect more with urban wildlife and strengthen their connection with local wild areas’ restoration efforts.

#### General Drafting Company, ***[America's products and the trucks that carry them](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8919287)*** (1958)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Screenshot 2025-01-10 105012.png" >}}

This is [a 1958 General Drafting Company pictorial map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8919287) of the United States, its industry, and the transportation network used to move its products. The map follows the 1956 Federal-Aid Highway Act, celebrating the success of the American Highway system and the hard work of truckers in moving goods along a growing network of interstate trade. 

Pictorial vignettes highlight American production, from agricultural goods to aircraft parts and automobiles. Corn, potatoes, walnuts, citrus fruit, and flour appear among the nation's agricultural products. Coal, lead, uranium ore, copper, aluminum, and phosphates are named among the nation's mineral resources. Farm machinery, shoes, synthetic rubber, textiles, and paper represent a handful of manufactured products. America's highway network, illustrated below the green vignettes in shades of gray, serves as a network of commerce. The trucks that create the map's border carry it all, with many still in use today. Many of these were designed with specific purposes in mind: logging, beverage panel trucks, telephone line trucks, bulk milk trucks, ice cream trucks, and vehicle carriers, etc.

#### Walker Lith., ***[Canobie Lake Park, Salem N.H.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633j682j)*** (1912)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:5d86s675x/full/1450,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Canobie Lake Park is a staple of New England summers. Now known for their roller coasters and Taylor Swift impersonator, the park was originally a “trolley park” located at the end of the Massachusetts Northeast Street Railway Company and was designed to encourage trolley use on the weekends. To that end, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633j682j) was initially designed as a foldable brochure. At the time of this map’s creation in 1912, Canobie Lake Park consisted of flower gardens, walking paths, and “gentle attractions” like a swimming pool.

#### ***[Panoramic view of Boston centered on the Prudential Tower](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:h128th21w)*** (1968)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:rj4356675/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:h128th21w) from 1968 shows a bird’s eye view of what the Prudential Tower and its surroundings looked like when it was first completed—spot the separate buildings that make up the tower in the middle (the compass rose marks the top of the tower).

When first built in the early 1960s, the shopping centre we know now was a part of a huge redevelopment wave in Boston (think Boston City Hall, Government Center, etc). It was originally a series of separated buildings with the main “Prudential Tower” as the centerpiece. Over the years, the buildings were connected, bridged, and developed into “the Pru” we know today that welcomes more than 60,000 visitors a day.
