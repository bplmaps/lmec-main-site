> *On February 7, we hosted **From The Vault: For the Love of Maps!***

Maps have so much to offer—from the rich history behind their creation and visual perspectives of familiar places to the depth of information they communicate and so much more. While the staff at the Leventhal Center have a special place in our hearts for all of our maps, there are just a few that each of us love the tiniest bit more than the others.

In this *From The Vault* collections showing, we took a look at the personal favorites of the staff at the Leventhal Center and the multitude of reasons these maps have captured our attention amongst our collection of over 250,000 maps.

#### Newton Horace Winchell, ***[A geological map of the Black Hills](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fb39t)*** (1875)

*Selected by Julia Williams, Gallery and Communications Coordinator*

Portraying the Black Hills (also known as the Six Grandfathers) mountain range of South Dakota and Wyoming, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fb39t) was created in 1875 during a time of major conflict in this region. Just a few years prior in 1868, the US government had signed a treaty “exempting the Black Hills from all non-indigenous settlement forever”. However, when gold was found in the area 6 years later, the US government conquered the Black Hills and forcibly relocated the Lakota people who were indigenous to the area.

50 years later, work began on this landmark on the sacred mountain range and in 1941, Mount Rushmore was opened to the public. Featuring the faces of 4 US presidents to represent the first 150 years of American history, the site now receives more than 2 million visitors a year.

> “This is my (current) favorite map in the collection because it’s so visually stunning with all the different bands of color, but primarily for the history that underlies this location. It reminds me that maps are simply a snapshot of a much larger picture of what’s going on in the world.”

#### William M. Coombs, ***[Map showing the sources of some of the offensive odors perceived in Boston, 1878](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:w3765q66z)*** (1878)

*Selected by Emily Bowe, Assistant Director*

This map from 1878 was made by the Boston Board of Health, at a time when the growing city was confronting issues about waste and public health. In red hatching, you'll see "mud-sewage flats" depicted in once-marshy areas of the city. You may also notice the numbered red dots along the edges of the wharves and land, indicating locations of sewage outlets. The makers of [the map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:w3765q66z) have drawn red arrows indicating the wind direction, which makes it easy to see which parts of the city would have been impacted by "offensive odors." 

> “I love this map because it helps visitors imagine the experience of walking through Boston streets in the late nineteenth century. It was probably pretty smelly to be in the newly-built Back Bay neighborhood, with the prevailing winds bringing smells of "mud-sewage flats" to where you're standing!”

#### Fuller & Whitney, c.e., ***[Plan of region west of Back Bay Park, Boston, Mass. : proposed improvements](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:t722mh264)*** (1886)

*Selected by Claire Tratnyek, Learning Resource Specialist*

[This 1886 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:t722mh264) with overlays of what is now known as the Fenway neighborhood of Boston shows an array of possible configurations for a new neighborhood that would be created entirely anew at the tail-end of the decades-long project of filling in Boston’s Back Bay. Would the streets along Frederick Law Olmsted’s Muddy River Park (then still in progress) be gridded and regular, or would they be sinuous and curving, like the river itself?

#### Lucy Durfee, ***[New England](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:2801vh693)*** (1834)

*Selected by Nicole Claris, Director of Education*

During the late 18th and early 19th century, it was common practice for American female students attending private academies to prepare maps of various parts of the world by copying maps from books or atlases. Most often, girls were taught by female instructors, who drew maps themselves to demonstrate geographic, artistic and design skills to their pupils. Potentially based on Jesse Olney's 1829 Map of the eastern states, it’s thought that the cartographer is possibly Lucy Durfee (Borden) of Rhode Island, 1821-1890, daughter of politician and jurist Job Durfee.

> “I was one of those kids that LOVED a school assignment. I don’t know how Lucy Durfee felt making [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:2801vh693) in 1834. Looking at it today—I see the care she took in delineating the coastlines, the neat lettering she used to label everything, and the precise application of color. It makes me want a box of sharpened colored pencils.”

#### Augustus Kollner & Morris H. Traubel, [The Hymenial Expositor, or, Matrimonial Chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n427b) (1849)

Selected by Zaila Alves, Visitor Services & Operations Assistant

This rather cynical bird’s-eye view map portraying the trials and tribulations of love and romance, as imagined in the context of mid-19th century life, is a cathartic break for some viewers who find themselves unsatisfied by what they perceive as ‘biased and sappy’ portrayals of love. With an image of a traditional marriage ceremony underneath the title, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n427b) rather surprisingly does not shy away from showing some of the stark realities that come with partnership and the many directions it can go. This can be seen quite clearly by the compass rose in the lower-left corner depicting the cardinal directions as "Hope", "Love", "Despair", and "Hatred".

“I like this map because it isn’t entirely pessimistic, as the “Bay of Delight”, “River Amour”, and “Fort of Felicity” icons in the upper-right corner show the joys possible in "The Great Ocean of Love". The iconography across the map is a fascinating blend of tragedy, joy, and humor, with personal favorites being the "Gulf of Self Love" in the upper-left corner and the "Sands of Inconstancy" in the lower-left corner.”

#### Walker Lith., ***[Canobie Lake Park, Salem N.H.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633j682j)*** (1912)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:5d86s675x/full/1450,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Canobie Lake Park is a staple of New England summers. Now known for their roller coasters and Taylor Swift impersonator, the park was originally a “trolley park” located at the end of the Massachusetts Northeast Street Railway Company and was designed to encourage trolley use on the weekends. To that end, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633j682j) was initially designed as a foldable brochure. At the time of this map’s creation in 1912, Canobie Lake Park consisted of flower gardens, walking paths, and “gentle attractions” like a swimming pool.

#### ***[Panoramic view of Boston centered on the Prudential Tower](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:h128th21w)*** (1968)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:rj4356675/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:h128th21w) from 1968 shows a bird’s eye view of what the Prudential Tower and its surroundings looked like when it was first completed—spot the separate buildings that make up the tower in the middle (the compass rose marks the top of the tower).

When first built in the early 1960s, the shopping centre we know now was a part of a huge redevelopment wave in Boston (think Boston City Hall, Government Center, etc). It was originally a series of separated buildings with the main “Prudential Tower” as the centerpiece. Over the years, the buildings were connected, bridged, and developed into “the Pru” we know today that welcomes more than 60,000 visitors a day.
