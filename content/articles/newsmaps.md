One goal of our current exhibition, [_Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines) is to help you make sense of the maps that appear in the news. Although the number of maps produced every day has exploded with the rise of television and social media, older forms of publication also churned out maps at a formidable pace, using them to tell people about far-off wars or newsworthy phenomena at home.

The U.S. armed forces produced their very own periodical during World War II that emphasized the link between mapmaking and news in its title: _Newsmap_. We [feature two issues of _Newsmap_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/why-persuade/waging-war/) in _Bending Lines_. But there are many more issues of this _Newsmap_ that also show how clever cartographic tricks were used to spin the official perspective on world events.

This December 17, 1945 issue of _Newsmap_ from the [University of North Texas's collections](https://digital.library.unt.edu/explore/collections/NMAP/browse/?q=&t=fulltext&sort=added_d) is a great example. It features an "unwrapped" globe, using an unfamiliar projection to highlight important elements of world events near the end of the war, at a time when the US was emerging as a superpower with global ambitions.

The author of this map chose their layout very carefully. Like the influential polar projection promoted by Richard Edes Harrison which we [discuss in _Bending Lines_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/how-to-bend/4.1.1/), this particular flattening of the globe deliberately emphasizes a geography of warfare and politics that spans thousands of miles.

The cities that this _Newsmap_ describes as central to world events are mostly laid out along the same latitude, around the 40th parallel. In December of 1945, the war had ended and a dramatic reorganization of world affairs had begun. It was several months after the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing well over 100,000 people and introducing a type of weaponry which utterly reshaped the spatial reach of modern warfare. In the aftermath, the US occupied Japan and worked to demilitarize it, among other changes.

This period was also the beginning of the Nuremberg trials, bringing Nazi war criminals and collaborators to justice in Europe. Because of these and other events which the _Newsmap_ publishers saw as the focus of the immediate postwar period, the Northern hemisphere—and the 40th parallel in particular—are the perspectival center of this map. This logic may have been somewhat circular; it was the countries of what we now call the Global North that had immolated themselves in a bloody and destructive conflict, and thus they considered themselves to be the most important players in the postward order as well.

In small text at the bottom, the map gives a short lesson about map projection, noting that the projection shown here minimizes distortion at 40 degrees north. _Newsmap_ often included [material about geographic education](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/why-persuade/1.6.2/), seeking to inculcate a sense of world-spanning knowledge in Americans that would equip them for a new national mission as the "global policeman."

On the other hand, the continents below the equator is distorted and literally falling off the map, relegating these nations to a less important status. All map projections have some kind of distortion, either of size or shape of land and water, or some combination of both. It's always important to note which parts of a map are represented accurately, and which are stretched and skewed.

The fact that South America and southern Africa are out of the frame is not surprising given the pro-western, Eurocentric nature of maps in the American press—and in particular those published by the military. The only point of interest to the mapmaker south of the equator is Uruguay. Along with Korea, Palestine, and Iran, the whole country is labeled rather than any specific city, unlike the circled points in Europe.
