One goal of our current exhibition, [_Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines) is to help you make sense of the maps that appear in the news. Although the number of maps produced every day has exploded with the rise of television and social media, even older forms of publication churned out maps at a formidable pace, using them to tell people about far-off wars or newsworthy phenomena at home.

The U.S. armed forced produced their very own periodical during World War II that emphasized the link between mapmaking and news in the title: _Newsmap_. We [feature two issues of _Newsmap_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/why-persuade/waging-war/) in _Bending Lines_. But there are many more issues of this _Newsmap_ that also show how clever cartographic tricks were used to spin the official perspective on world events.

This December 17, 1945 issue of _Newsmap_ from the [University of North Texas's collections](https://digital.library.unt.edu/explore/collections/NMAP/browse/?q=&t=fulltext&sort=added_d) is a great example. It features an unwrapped globe that highlights important elements of contemporary happenings in which the US had a stake.

The author of this world map chose their layout very carefully. The cities that are a part of the narrative are mostly laid out along the same latitude, around the 40th parallel. In December of 1945, WWII had ended and a reorganization of world affairs had begun. It was several months after the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing well over 100,000 people. In the aftermath, the US occupied Japan and worked to demilitarize it, among other changes. This period was also the beginning of the Nuremberg trials, bringing Nazi war criminals and collaborators to justice in Europe. Because of these and other events judged most important to the mapmaker, the Northern hemisphere and the 40th parallel in particular are the focus of this map. This logic may be somewhat circular -- in some ways, perhaps these are the events judged most important because of their locations.

In small text at the bottom, the map says that the projection used minimizes distortion at 40 degrees North! On the other hand, some of the land below the equator is distorted and literally falling off the map, relegating it to a less important status. All map projections have some kind of distortion, either of size or shape of land and water, or some combination of both. It's always important to note which parts of a map are represented accurately, and which are stretched and skewed.

The fact that South America and southern Africa are out of the frame is not surprising given the pro-western, Eurocentric nature of maps in the American press. The only point of interest to the mapmaker south of the equator is Uruguay. Along with Korea, Palestine, and Iran, the whole country is labeled rather than any specific city, unlike the circled points in Europe.
