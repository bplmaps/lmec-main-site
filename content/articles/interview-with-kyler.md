Hiya Kyler! Here are some questions for the interview (you can use [this](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/welcome-ian-spangler/ "https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/welcome-ian-spangler/") and [this](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/welcome-emily-bowe/ "https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/welcome-emily-bowe/") as a reference too, and feel free to change questions to your liking):

1. Tell us a little bit about yourself and your background (academic interests, where you're from, etc.). What made you interested in the Leventhal Map & Education Center?

I'm Kyler Hoogendoorn-Ecker, and I'm a rising senior at the Boston Latin School. I've lived in the Jamaica Plain/Roxbury area my whole life and I love the richness of cultures and diversity that the neighborhood holds. I have many relatives around the world (especially in the Netherlands), whom I'm lucky to be able to visit often, so I've had an interest in travel and world geography since I was very young. I think that geography is fascinating and I have spent many hours of my free time looking at maps and learning the names and capitals of as many countries as I can. I pride myself on being interested in an array of different subjects, with the study of Latin and the Classics being chief among them, as well as literature in general: I'm an avid reader and I like nothing more than a good book. The Leventhal Center seems to me a place where knowledge and ideas are everywhere; it's a gold mine of new information to learn and I think my sense of curiosity is a major part of what drove me here.

1. Have you had any experiences—volunteer work, stuff at school, etc.—that has made you particularly curious about maps and geography?

I find that

1. You mentioned that you like to go for long walks, often getting lost along the way. I love this because I've always found "getting lost" to be such a human experience and one that's tied deeply to geography. What about that experience excites you? In what ways do you see it being related to maps or geography?

To me, this kind of experience is a microcosm of being completely "off the beaten path", and about as close as one can get to that in an urban environment. There's something freeing in having to rely only on your wits and memory to navigate and in building a personal relationship with the places around me: they have my own names and  

To me, in a way, making a mental map of an area establishes a relationship with it, and I think of familiarizing myself with the parks and woods in my neighborhood like building friendships with the space

Do you have a favorite map in the LMEC collections?

1. What kinds of longer term plans do you think your upcoming work at the Map Center might help you prepare for?
2. What are you most looking forward to about working at the Center this summer?
