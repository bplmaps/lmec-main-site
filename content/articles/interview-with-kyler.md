Hiya Kyler! Here are some questions for the interview (you can use [this](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/welcome-ian-spangler/ "https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/welcome-ian-spangler/") and [this](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/welcome-emily-bowe/ "https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/welcome-emily-bowe/") as a reference too, and feel free to change questions to your liking):

* Tell us a little bit about yourself and your background (academic interests, where you're from, etc.). What made you interested in the Leventhal Map & Education Center?

I'm Kyler Hoogendoorn-Ecker, and I'm a rising senior at the Boston Latin School. I've lived in the Jamaica Plain/Roxbury area my whole life and I love the richness of cultures and diversity that the neighborhood holds. I have many relatives around the world (especially in the Netherlands), whom I'm lucky to be able to visit often, so I've had an interest in travel and world geography since I was very young. I think that geography is fascinating and I have spent many hours of my free time looking at maps and learning the names and capitals of as many countries as I can. I pride myself on being interested in an array of different subjects, with the study of Latin and the Classics being chief among them, as well as literature in general: I'm an avid reader and I like nothing more than a good book. The Leventhal Center seems to me a place where knowledge and ideas are everywhere; it's a gold mine of new information to learn and I think my sense of curiosity is a major part of what drove me here.

* Have you had any experiences—volunteer work, stuff at school, etc.—that has made you particularly curious about maps and geography?

Honestly, I don't have much experience working with or even learning about geography in a formal setting. Most of my learning about world geography is self-taught, and

* You mentioned that you like to go for long walks, often getting lost along the way. I love this because I've always found "getting lost" to be such a human experience and one that's tied deeply to geography. What about that experience excites you? In what ways do you see it being related to maps or geography?

I love to venture out into the parks of Boston with no specific plan in mind and to go where my mind takes me. To me, this kind of experience is a microcosm of being completely "off the beaten path", and about as close as one can get to that in an urban environment. There's something freeing in having to rely only on your wits and memory to navigate and in building a personal relationship with the places around me: they have my own names and their identities depend on my interactions with them. I think that mapping a place is an intimate experience that can hold a lot of meaning. The things that we subjectively value or notice about a space (and therefore display in our representations of that place, i.e. maps) might be entirely different from another's. Being my own geographer, albeit on a very tiny scale, is a very rewarding experience, and I recommend it to all. Lest I worry too much about getting lost, I have ready access to the work of better cartographers than me with a few buttons, but I always try to use Google Maps as a last resort to finding my way. In my opinion, although using this common resource has of course countless benefits, it also depersonalizes our relationship with the spaces we inhabit. It might be easier to say "XXX street" than "that place where we first met that one time", but there's something a little less magical about it, isn't there?

* Do you have a favorite map in the LMEC collections?
* What kinds of longer term plans do you think your upcoming work at the Map Center might help you prepare for?

  I think
* What are you most looking forward to about working at the Center this summer?

  I am really excited to explore the fantastic collection of maps here and I'm expecting to have learned so much through my work by the time the summer is over. I'm almost incredulous to be in a place where there's so much to discover and I couldn't be happier to have this opportunity. I'm also especially looking forward to putting my own work to the Map Center, whether that be through investigating and writing about maps in the catalog, doing georeferencing on maps already here, or something else! I believe that learning should be approached not only as a consumer, but an active participant and creator. I hope to
