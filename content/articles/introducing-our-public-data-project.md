Our world is awash in data. The widespread availability of computers and Internet access has made it possible to aggregate and share information at scales that even just a few decades ago would have been almost unimaginable. Geospatial information is a major part of this data revolution. Data sets provided by institutions like the [City of Boston](https://data.boston.gov) or the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) offer incredible sources of information on topics ranging from poverty to environmental change—ready to be analyzed and mapped by anyone.

But is it really true that _anyone_ can work with this data? In spite of the push to make geospatial data "open" and "public," meaningful  access to geospatial resources is too often isolated behind technical systems that are built for experts, and a steep learning curve looms formidably in front of those who might like to take "raw" data and create maps, stories, and arguments from it. 

Sixty years ago, if you wanted to access statistical information about your community, you might have visited a research library like the BPL and requested atlases, reports, and government publications. Today, even though that kind of information is available freely online, it can ironically be _more_ difficult to access when it's trapped inside of file formats and confusing databases. 

We're thrilled to announce that we're embarking on a project that aims at solving some of these challenges. As recipients of a Seed Fund Grant from the [Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub](https://nebigdatahub.org), we're going to be working to provide broader access to digital geographic information.

Our project involves building both "technical infrastructure" and "social infrastructure." On the technical side, we're creating an all-new portal for describing and documenting useful geographic data sets about Boston and the region for nonexpert useres, with an emphasis on human readability. Our portal will foreground concerns around how data sets related to one another. It will also describe data in a way that asks critical questions about who and what is represented—and how.

Technical solutions alone, however, aren't enough for widening access to data. That's why we're also building institutional support for members of the public who want to work with geospatial information. We'll be documenting the new data portal and supporting it with easy-to-use training material, training materials aimed at adult library patrons and K-12 teachers. To launch all of this work in its trial phase, we'll be developing a new, free educational program and offering it remotely next spring. Working with our Education team, our goal is to equip participants with the skills, confidence, and critical disposition that's necessary for doing good work with data.

#### The team

At the LMEC, this project will be managed by [Garrett Dash Nelson](/about/people/garrett-nelson), Curator of Maps & Director of Geographic Scholarship, and [Belle Lipton](/about/people/belle-lipton), Geospatal & Cartographic Information Librarian. We're joined by our Education staff, [Michelle LeBlanc](/about/people/michelle-leblanc) and [Lynn Brown](/about/people/lynn-brown), who will be heading up efforts to introduce these programs to K-12 teachers.

As advisors to the project, we're collaborating with [Catherine D'Ignazio](https://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/catherine-dignazio) and [Eric Robsky Huntley](https://www.ericrobskyhuntley.org) of the Department of Urban Studies & Planning at MIT. They're both leaders in the world of critical data studies; check out D'Ignazio's new book (with Lauren Klein) [_Data Feminism_](http://datafeminism.io), and watch Huntley [talk about counter-cartographies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpVOiIdZao) at the most recent NACIS conference. 

Three fantastic MIT students, our first cohort of Public Data Fellows, will be building the portal documentation, training material, and educational program together with us. [Tess McCann](https://tessmccann.com) is a second year Master's in City Planning student with a background in graphic design and project management and a passion for history and maps. Sarah Lohmar is a third-year undergraduate in Urban Planning with Computer Science excited about merging education with data and Missy Hill is an undergraduate in the Department of Urban Studies & Planning interested in the relationships between scientific discoveries and the communities they impact.
