Our world is awash in data. The widespread availability of computers and Internet access has made it possible to aggregate and share information at scales that even just a few decades ago would have been unforeseeable. In particular, geospatial information provided by institutions from the [City of Boston](https://data.boston.gov) to the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) provides tantalizing evidence on topics ranging from poverty to environmental change, ready to be analyzed and mapped by anyone.

But is it really true that _anyone_ can work with this data? In spite of the push to make geospatial data "open" and "public," meaningful and durable access to geospatial resources is too often isolated behind technical systems that are built for experts, and a steep learning curve looms formidably in front of those who might like to take "raw" data and create maps, stories, and arguments from it.

Sixty years ago, if you wanted to access statistical information about your community, you might well have visited a research library like the BPL and requested atlases, reports, and . Today, even though that kind of information is available freely online, it can ironically be _more difficult_ to access when it's trapped inside of file formats and confusing databases where 

We are thrilled to announce that we are embarking on a project that aims at solving some of these challenge. As recipients of a Seed Fund Grant from the [Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub](https://nebigdatahub.org),
