Last week I spoke with [Joe Bagley, Boston's city archaeologist](https://www.boston.gov/departments/archaeology/joe-bagley) about our tool [Atlascope](atlascope.leventhalmap.org) and how he uses it to do work that is vital to Boston historical research. Atlascope is a project of digitally transforming atlases of Boston from about 1860-1940, as well as nearby cities, to line up with modern day maps of the city. We've georeferenced these maps, which basically means we've taken a spot on a historic map and its corresponding spot on a modern map, laid them on top of one another, and then repeated the process all over Boston until the maps align.

This tool helps improve access to these materials that are vital to understanding local history and historical geography. So if you have a geography-related research project brewing, check it out! You don't have to be a professional archaeologist to dig in.

When he begins looking at a property, Bagley needs to prove that he understands what would have been on a site for its entire history, going back to the retreat of the glaciers about 16,000  years ago. To begin his research, Bagley starts with a map: 

> "It gives me most of the information I need right off the bat. I get the shape of the building over time, I use the atlases to get the owners of the buildings over time too, and that gives me my basic structure to start the deed research, which usually goes back further than the atlases are available. but at least I know I'm on the right house. It eventually connects to all the other owners I have from the atlases. So it really nicely bookends what I need to know. I can check for outbuildings to see if there's a privy in the backyard, I can look at the changes in the nearby landscape and watch buildings encroach, and basically before I even look up the first person on the site I have a really strong idea of how that place changed over time or didn't change over time."

For Bagley, Atlascope is a necessary tool. "I don't know how anyone could do what I do in a city that doesn't have as many digital maps. Because I need to literally go owner by owner, property by property back in time and atlascope is the exact thing that I need to do that."

Before he had the tool, he would physically come to the Map Center or to the Massachusett State Library to look at urban atlases of the city. Sometimes, using the real atlases, which are about two by three feet large (closed), he couldn't get a good read on how today's streets corresponded to yesterday's. Other times, he simply didn't have as much data as he does now for a dig, not realizing how many Bromleys were available for a certain neighborhood.

A great example of how Boston change needs to be georeferenced is City Square in Charlestown, "where all the streets have the same name and are in *vaguely* the same place after the Big Dig, but they aren't: they're all moved around a little bit. So if you look at the maps you may think you're in one place based on the orientation of the street, but they were all moved in the 80's and 90's. You're actually in a totally different spot, and the road was 20 or 30 feet over. It's a fundamentally different space, and you can only get that if you're using the georeferenced maps because then you can see oh, this has been tweaked a little bit."

"I don't necessarily use it as a to the inch measurement," says Bagley. But for a recent example, [the well discovered as a sinkhole in Ronan Park](https://www.dotnews.com/2021/plumbing-history-ronan-park-sinkhole-site), "we knew where the well was, we could put it on the map and do the overlays, and depending on what year map it was, the well was on either side of the property line. And that was really meaningful to our research, because we had to figure out whether the well was the new well that Mary Pierce had to dig as part of the deed that we had documentation for, or if it was the existing well that she had to replace when she bought the property. We still don't really know the answer, but the fact that it was right on that borderline gave us a much more interesting story and two options that we could kind of explore in the interpretation of that."

One of the most important things that Atlascope can help Bagley determine is whether or not there even is a site to uncover in a particular area. 

> "There's been a couple of instances where the site would have been amazing until about 1870 when somebody put a massive brick building on top of it with a clear foundation that took out the really cool archaeological site. That happened recently when I was reviewing what was a florist directly north of Faneuil Hall that's now Sephora. They were putting utilities in that building and were gonna be trenching and digging around it so I had jurisdiction, and I could have made them do a dig first but I was looking at that property and it would have been exactly where the old feather store was, which is a really important building going back to the 17th century, one of the oldest houses that was standing until the 19th c when it was torn down.

> "But the Bromleys told me that after the building was torn down, every square inch of that property was developed with solid building so there is no yard anymore  because the yard would have been dug out for all the buildings that came in. So basically it could have been a really cool site of there was an archaeologist working in the late 19th century, but now it's gone. So it allows me to kind of write off areas quickly and not get too far down the road for research which can take months before a dig. So it's both the thing that allows me to do the research but it also allows me to avoid research of things that are gone."

<iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/#view:embed$base:001$overlay:39999059010908$zoom:19.07$center:-7910293.983389088,5214944.858871568$mode:glass$pos:586"></iframe>

Another nearby example Bagley brought up was Scollay Square, which was destroyed to build Government Center.  Here, 19th century development happened so thoroughly that in the end, there was no yard space left in the area that could have housed artifacts. Because of this, Bagley could make the informed decision not to dig, knowing that the only sites he had to work with were rubble in mid-20th century basements.

For Bagley, and for anyone doing this type of research, Atlascope saves a lot of time. We do recommend, of course, coming and seeing our collections in person when that's possible again. But it's hard to argue with the ease with which you can call up maps on Atlascope and compare different years to one another! Not only can you see the maps easily, legibly, and in very high quality, but you can download high resolution scans with just a couple of clicks.

Bagley also complimented our inclusion of other cities and suburbs of Boston in Atlascope, which we also love! While he's the city archaeologist for Boston only and doesn't have much use for it, he recognizes how powerful this is for people from outside Boston. "One thing I don't talk about ever which is really important for folks using this is that you have not just Boston. That you have the nearby towns also included in this is really incredible. I don't really have a use for them, but I think that there's been a lot of people that I showed mapjunction and they were like, "What about Cambridge?" But this has Cambridge, it has Brookline, it has Somerville. All these other towns are included in the maps which is so helpful. Boston's the capital of the region, and while it feels like everyone gravitates towards us they also wants to know their story, so I think it's really nice that you have all that data available as well."

And finally, he pointed out that this is a tool with a lot of future applications. It's an infrastructure that's ripe with so much potential, from creating 3d walkthroughs of the North End to tagging historical photographs with geospatial information, to new ways of storymapping, and who knows what else. We hope you enjoy using Atlascope as much as Joe Bagley, and as always, drop us a line if you've got a project you need help on!
