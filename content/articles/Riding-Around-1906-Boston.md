  Boston is an ever-evolving city, so it can be difficult to imagine just how
  different Boston looked and functioned over century ago. 


  In this two-part article series, friend of the Center, Gerald A. Rosenthal,
  explores the history and infrastructure of Boston in 1906 and also uses the
  1906 film Seeing Boston to provide a detailed tour by trolley car through the
  city.

In the first installment of this series, *[Time Travel Back to 1906 Boston](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/time-travel-back-to-1906-boston/)*, we glimpsed what Boston was like when Billy Bitner rode through the streets filming scenes of daily life. Here we’ll hop onboard the streetcar and accompany him on his journey.

### Starting Downtown

We begin on Tremont Street traveling toward Boston Common. The small building at the southeast corner on the Common is the Boylston subway station, which at the time was less than ten years old. Many of the surrounding buildings had been erected over the previous decade, including the Masonic temple, which is on the corner to the left as we turn onto Boylston. The building on the right is a hotel, but a century earlier that site had been the location of John Quincy Adams’ home.

Riding east down Boylston Street, we see a sign for Washburn’s Department Store, with a smaller one saying they offer clothes on credit. Next to the commercial signage, we see a three-dimensional plaque with a tree. That marks the location of the Liberty Tree, the site of a gathering of the Sons of Liberty in pre-Revolutionary Boston. The building and tree marker are still there, though Washburn’s is long gone.
