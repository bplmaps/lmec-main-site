### New collections come to the Map Center

At its simplest, geographic information systems (GIS) refers to the use of computers to create, store, and analyze spatial data. Here at the Map Center, we're fascinated by how GIS has changed the way people create maps and data---and while the history of GIS has been [fairly](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/GIS:+A+Short+Introduction-p-9780631235330) [well](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C504966) [documented](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C2037006), dedicated collections of maps produced during its early days still remain rare.[^1] That's why we're thrilled to welcome to Map Center two new archival collections chronicling this era: the **Applied Geographics, Inc. Records** and the **David J. Weaver Collection**.

Donated by David Weaver, [founder and former president of Applied Geographics](https://www.appgeo.com/tribute-to-a-benevolent-founder/), these collections encompass hundreds of cartographic objects including maps, data creation tools, software and data manuals, and more. Taken together, they provide a unique glimpse into major changes in cartographic design, process, and philosophy between the late 1970s and 2012.

For example, this **shadeset** was used to {{<popup src="/images/blog/gis2-crop.png" class="popupTooltip" target="blank">}}select colors on an electrostatic plotter.{{</popup>}}Electrostatic plotters were commonly used for map printing in the 1980s and '90s, until laser printing became widely affordable and accessible.

Comparing the shadeset to contemporary color picker tools---like this color editor in ArcGIS Pro---serves as a useful reminder of how seemingly simple cartographic processes have undergone numerous . In other words, resources like these aren't mere nostalgia for a time when printers were a little different: they help illuminate the material histories and practices associated with geography, computation, and GIS. 

### Major areas of collecting interest

Galvanized by these new collections, the Map Center is eagerly collecting in the area of early computer cartography. This includes maps, datasets, papers, and other cartographic objects that reflect:

- changes in cartographic practice or process
- municipal, state, or corporate mapping projects and partnerships
- advances in computation
- pre-GIS maps and mapmaking hardware

In 1962, the landscape architect Ian McHarg devised [the "layer-cake" method](https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/mcharg-design-with-nature-50th-anniversary/) of visualizing geospatial data. 


### Why now? The paradox of new maps

Despite undergoing radical changes over the years, many conceptual aspects of mapmaking have remained the same. Cartographers still rely on {{<popup src="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05-fig-5-4-v2.png" class="popupTooltip" target="blank">}}"cake-layering"{{</popup>}}---a method [popularized by Ian McHarg](https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/mcharg-design-with-nature-50th-anniversary/---to represent distinct geographic features. Furthermore, GIS doesn't suitably capture the wide range of practices and theories associated with creating and storing spatial data over the long history of computer cartography. Many years

### Practice, process, and politics

With a focus on the years of 1960 and 2000, we are excited to grow our collections that exemplify the changes in **practice, process, and politics** around computer cartography and mapmaking.

1. Practice

In the area of **cartographic practice**, we're interested in 

2. Process



3. Politics

<!-- "Today's GIS professionals may be excused for not knowing the many pathways that comprise the current global mosaic of GIS systems, methods, people, and projoects," writes Timothy W. Foresman in his *History of Geographic Information Systems*. "Indeed thousands of attendees at annual vendor-organized GIS user conferences may be patently ignorant of any specific vendor's place in this history."[^2]

The situation Foresman's observation rings true today, despite the fact that he wrote those sentences in 1998. -->


<!-- The last six decades witnessed revolutionary advances in computation that changed how we create maps and data. Thanks to new hardware and software, mapmakers could increasingly approach their work in terms of [data-storage elements, computer inputs, and data-processing outputs](https://www.jstor.org/stable/212211?seq=1). These developments not only impacted how maps were made, but perhaps more importantly, how people conceived of space and place. -->
