This past June, the Leventhal Center partnered with our wonderful colleagues at [Civic Switchboard](https://civic-switchboard.github.io/) to host an extended workshop on civic data.

Broadly defined, civic data includes data produced by governmental organizations, non-profits, civic institutions like libraries, and other community-based organizations. We welcomed 12 library workers from the greater Boston area for two days of education about how to develop civic data roles for their libraries and strengthen connections across different institutions. We’re so grateful to have worked with the Civic Switchboard organizers, including Liz Monk, Chelsea Gunn, and Nora Mattern, to facilitate discussions of born-digital data preservation & access, map our civic data ecosystems, and learn more about the critical importance of data literacy. Check out some photos from the event to see learning in action!
