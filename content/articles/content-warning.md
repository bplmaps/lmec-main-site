Since September, weâ€™ve been posting random crops of random maps from our digital collections on twitter with our bot, auto_mapic. For us, itâ€™s been a great way to engage with our collections from a safe distance! It has also sparked a lot of conversation at the Map Center about our objects and how to present them in the most ethical way, especially those that contain offensive imagery.

We started this conversation when we set up the bot, but it became much more real a month later when auto_mapic tweeted this image from a 1949 puzzle map:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excerpt from &quot;United States inlay puzzle&quot; ([1949]) <a href="https://t.co/nlGkyU0bIX">https://t.co/nlGkyU0bIX</a> <a href="https://t.co/sx7n3iTl3J">pic.twitter.com/sx7n3iTl3J</a></p>&mdash; A U T O M A P I C ðŸ¤– (@auto_mapic) <a href="https://twitter.com/auto_mapic/status/1314197117007802368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This jigsaw puzzle, like many mass-consumption items with art produced by commercial illustrators, includes crude stereotypes of the United States's regional cultures, with racist depictions of Black Americans in the South. The crop randomly selected by the bot includes one of the most offensive of these images. The Delta region was and is home to some of the most original and important cultural traditions in the United States, including the famous Delta Blues. In this map, however, these are ignored in favor of an offensive cartoon. An image like this, appearing in a puzzle that would have been used by children and families, is a reminder of how racist stereotypes are reiterated through countless mundane examples of marginalization, mockery, and caricature.

Having this puzzle up on our botâ€™s twitter feed with no context felt wrong. We added some of the text from the previous paragraph in order to help explain it to anyone who might stumble upon it accidentally, but we also opened up our conversation to the reality that these images, which are in our digital collections and already available online, have a dubious importance. While we believe they are racist, insensitive, and demeaning, they are also a piece of cultural history that cannot be contained and hidden, separate from the rest of the collections. Many pictorial maps from the 20th century have this problem, with caricatures of BIPOC. Quite a few of our older maps have depictions of cannibals around the margins of the New World, illustrating what was incorrectly assumed to be a general barbaric practice.

Should these maps be digitized and publicly available? What purpose do they serve the public? Do we have a responsibility to contextualize them, or should we trust that others can interpret for themselves? Is there a difference between someone finding this map in our collections and seeing it on Twitter? As a staff, we donâ€™t agree on the answers to all of these questions. Probably no group of people would! But especially as a staff with no Black people on it, we sought professional help.

Weâ€™ve now had some conversations with Boston Public Library collections staff on the topic that have informed how we will deal with this going forward. Their photography collections include many nude pictures, for example, that they are planning to cover up with an 18+ click through. We have a page up on our site now on contextualizing collections, particularly the fact that so much of the works we have were produced in the name of colonialism. Weâ€¦
