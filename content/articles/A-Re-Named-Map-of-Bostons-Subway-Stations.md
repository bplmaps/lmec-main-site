At the end of 2023, we asked our supporters to help us out with a creative and collaborative map project: renaming Boston's subway stations. For the month of November, donors bid on the "rights" to re-name various stations on the red, orange, green and blue lines. Today, we're thrilled to present the final transit map. This map covers it allâ€”from historical references and neighborhood locales to imaginative puns and names that relay the daily experiences (or frustrations) of Boston's public transit riders. We think they did a great job of capturing the spirit of each station!
