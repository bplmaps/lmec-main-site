  At the end of 2023, we asked our supporters to help us out with a creative and
  collaborative map project: renaming Boston's subway stations. We're thrilled
  to present the final transit map, and think they did a great job capturing the
  spirit of each station!


  Visit our gallery in the Central Library to see the full map with all the new
  station names. You can help us launch fun projects like this by becoming a

At the end of 2023, we asked our supporters to help us out with a creative and collaborative map project: renaming Boston's subway stations. We're thrilled to present the final transit map, and think they did a great job capturing the spirit of each station!

This map covers it all - from 

Historical references

to highlighting neighborhood locales (Good Gas, End of the World, Bow Market, Fat Cat)

Names the relay the daily experiences (or frustrations) of Boston's public transit riders (Escelator to Hell, Screech)

We think they did a great job of capturing the spirit of each station on the Red, Orange, Blue, and Green lines!
