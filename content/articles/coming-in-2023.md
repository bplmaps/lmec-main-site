As we move into the new year, we are eager to unveil not one, but two, new exhibitions! In past years, our gallery has housed one rotating exhibition at a time; Most recently, we exhibited [More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/) in 2022, [Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/) in 2021-2022, and [America Transformed: Mapping the 19th Century](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/25) in 2019-2020. For the 2023 year, we're experimenting with a new split gallery model: a rotating exhibition on one side and a permanent exhibition on the other.

## Rotating Exhibition

### Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases 

## Permanent Exhibition

### Becoming Boston: Eight Moments in the Geography of a Changing City
