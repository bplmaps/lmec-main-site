As we move into the new year, we are eager to unveil not one, but two, new exhibitions! In past years, our gallery has housed one rotating exhibition at a time; Most recently, we exhibited [More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/) in 2022, [Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/) in 2021-2022, and [America Transformed: Mapping the 19th Century](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/25) in 2019-2020. For the 2023 year, we're experimenting with a new split gallery model: a rotating exhibition on one side and a permanent exhibition on the other.

### Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases 

**Rotating Exhibition**

In the period spanning the Civil War to World War II, Boston’s urban fabric experienced profound changes. The city filled in new neighborhoods, annexed suburbs serviced by streetcars, and ventured on ambitious infrastructure to stake its claim as a metropolis worthy of the name. With each development, opportunities for new types of social interactions emerged in tandem. As communities and individuals responded to a shifting urban landscape, countless stories unfurled and brought life into the folds of a complex city. _Building Blocks_ explores this extraordinary moment of transformation through the lens of the Center's urban atlases, a collection of maps that display property, {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:m900rg483/2690,3515,1705,1685/1200,/0/default.jpg" target="blank" >}} street, {{</popup>}} utility, and {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:m900r8914/5713,3422,1602,1305/1200,/0/default.jpg" target="blank" >}} building information, {{</popup>}} and are especially well-suited for discovering change by tracking small-scale interventions in the built environment. 

### Becoming Boston: Eight Moments in the Geography of a Changing City

**Permanent Exhibition**

Maps trace out the complicated history of places, and we can use them to document geography in the same way that we can use diaries and letters to document biography. In the eight cases of this exhibition, we follow the changing spatial forms of the place we now call Boston—from before the landscape carried that name all the way through the struggles, clashes, and dreams that continue to reshape the city today. These maps don’t merely depict facts about how the city looked at different moments in its history. Instead, they invite us to contemplate how geographic forces, both natural and human, have constructed the physical and social world around us, through large and small transformations that have transpired over many centuries. 

We begin ...
