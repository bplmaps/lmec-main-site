As we move into the new year, we are eager to unveil not one, but two, new exhibitions. In past years, our gallery has housed one rotating exhibition at a time; Most recently, we exhibited [More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/) in 2022, [Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/) in 2021-2022, and [America Transformed: Mapping the 19th Century](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/25) in 2019-2020. For the 2023 year, we're experimenting with a new split gallery model: a featured exhibition on one side and a permanent exhibition on the other.

### Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases

**Featured exhibition**

In the period spanning the Civil War to World War II, Boston’s urban fabric experienced profound changes. The city filled in new neighborhoods, annexed suburbs serviced by streetcars, and ventured on ambitious infrastructure to stake its claim as a metropolis worthy of the name.

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:m900rg440/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" caption="The cover page of this [1895 Atlas of the City of Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:tt44pv85c) includes an index for hundreds of streets." class="figure-right" >}}

With each development, opportunities for new types of social interactions emerged in tandem. As communities and individuals responded to a shifting urban landscape, countless stories unfurled and brought life into the folds of a complex city. _Building Blocks_ explores this extraordinary moment of transformation through the lens of the Center's urban atlases, a collection of {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:m900rg55h/full/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}}maps{{</popup>}}  that display property, street, utility, and building information, and are especially well-suited for discovering change by tracking small-scale interventions in the built environment.

##### Small-scale stories of urban change

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:m900rg49c/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" caption="" class="figure-right" >}}

Visitors will discover how the atlas collection opens up a world of fascinating stories, with vignettes including the country’s first {{< popup src="/uploads/2022-12-22/african-meeting-house.png"  target="blank" >}}African Meeting House{{</popup>}}  in the heart of Beacon Hill, landmarks of leisure like the {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9g54xx05z/7377,3143,1104,1108/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}}Derby Racer{{</popup>}}  and Giant Safety Thriller amusement rides in Revere, and public {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9k41zj68t/10272,6295,1653,1332/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}}health infrastructure{{</popup>}}  on Gallops Island in the former South Bay.

Among these vignettes are a collection of local histories uncovered and reconstructed by a team of teen curators from Boston Public Schools, including the origins of {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1257bz48b/363,1820,2174,2333/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}}Ronan Park{{</popup>}}  in Dorchester, {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1257c3889/5368,1700,2076,1881/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}}Kelleher Rose Garden{{</popup>}} in Back Bay Fens, the once-bustling {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7d27c9442/1008,464,2283,2304/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}}cattle industry {{</popup>}}  of Brighton.

##### People and their places

The maps in this exhibition tell stories that are ultimately about people, but the stories of some people are harder to find than others. In the case of Boston’s Black community, the urban atlases don’t always tell us as much as we might want to know. To illuminate the lives and stories that sometimes run hidden through these maps, _Building Blocks_ follows the biography of an important Black Bostonian, {{< popup src="/uploads/2022-12-22/cc_convention.jpeg"  target="blank" >}}Florida Ruffin Ridley{{</popup>}}  who worked, studied, played, and created within the landscapes on display. 

Beyond the stories narrated in this exhibition, the rich details of the atlases hint at thousands, or even millions, of others, and we invite visitors to discover stories of their own.

### Becoming Boston: Eight Moments in the Geography of a Changing City

**Permanent exhibition**

Maps trace out the complicated history of places, and we can use them to document geography in the same way that we can use diaries and letters to document biography. In the eight cases of this exhibition, we follow the changing spatial forms of the place we now call Boston—from before the landscape carried that name all the way through the struggles, clashes, and dreams that continue to reshape the city today. 

These maps don’t merely depict facts about how the city looked at different moments in its history. Instead, they invite us to contemplate how geographic forces, both natural and human, have constructed the physical and social world around us, through large and small transformations that have transpired over many centuries.

##### From colonial contact to 21st-century Boston

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f462s91s/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" caption="Notice colonial place names on this \~1675 [map of New England](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462s90h)." class="figure-right" >}}

We begin in the 17th century at the point of colonial contact. For thousands of years, Native peoples have built their homes and nations around Massachusetts Bay, and today the region is still home to members of the Massachusett tribe as well as Indigenous people from across the Americas. [Maps of this period](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?_=1671809539848&f%5Bsubject_geographic_sim%5D%5B%5D=New+England&q=&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=1600&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bend%5D=1700&search_field=dummy_range) show New England as the Europeans wanted it to appear, with Native peoples receding into the hinterland and new territories forming the outlines of a colonial geography.
