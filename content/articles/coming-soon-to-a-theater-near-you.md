Moviemaps are back! For those who may be new to this interactive, Moviemaps was [first created in the spring of 2021](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/roll-the-tape-with-moviemaps/) to solve a challenge presented by limitations of online learning: how can we narrate observations about a digitized map while still giving the viewer freedom to control and explore the view themselves? More specifically, how can we digitally recreate the in-person experience of map viewing? Enter [Moviemaps](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/movie-maps/#trolley-wayfinder). With Moviemaps, we pair a video discussion with digital collections objects that zoom and pan while synchronized with the video. But in Moviemaps, the viewer can also explore on their own, dragging the map around or pausing the video to get deeper into a different part of the map.

In the latest editions, Gallery Attendant [Miranda Fernandez](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/miranda-fernandez/) and Public Engagement Coordinator [Megan Nally](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/megan-nally/) take a look at two of the most popular maps from our [Bending Lines](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/) exhibition. 

Watch the videos and explore the accompanying maps yourself. When youâ€™re done, let us know what maps you want to see us discuss next: tag us [@bplmaps](https://twitter.com/bplmaps) or [send us a message](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/contact-connect).
