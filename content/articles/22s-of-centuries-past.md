### '22s of Centuries Past

Happy New year from all of us here at the Map Center! We wish you a 2022 full of good health and happiness.

To celebrate, we’ve rounded up some of our favorite maps created or published in the ‘22s of centuries past.

#### 1722

We begin in the 18th century. Many maps produced during this period shift away from the beloved [whimsical features](https://www.britannica.com/science/map/18th-century-to-the-present) of the 16th and 17th century––map monsters, sea creatures, decorative details––and instead largely focus on newly-developed [scientific methods](https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/exploration-settlement/pathfinders-passageways/Pages/mapmakers-essay.aspx) of cartography.

A good deal of 18th century maps in our collection come from French cartographer [Guillaume de I’Isle](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?f%5Bname_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=L%27Isle%2C+Guillaume+de%2C+1675-1726). De I’Isle published his first works in the year 1700 and, in 1718, became the chief geographer to King Louis XV of France.
