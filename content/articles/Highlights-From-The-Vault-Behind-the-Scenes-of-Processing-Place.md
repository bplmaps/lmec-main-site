> *On September 27, we hosted **From The Vault: Behind the Scenes of Processing Place***.

Consisting of early GIS maps of Massachusetts, alongside other cartographic objects that helped give insight into the early relationships of computers and cartographers, this From the Vault focused on objects that give a window into the early period of computer cartography, but that didn’t quite make the cut for our current gallery exhibition. Impressed by what you see here? Be sure to see the objects that did make the cut in our current exhibition, [Processing Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/), in the [Leventhal Map & Education Center gallery](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/visit/).

##### MassGIS ***[Views of Cape Ann](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:2b88vr376)*** (1990)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:zw133h24g/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map is an early example of maps made using corporate mapping software, Arc/INFO, and printed with electrostatic printers. In the center table in the gallery, you can see a sample color swatch diagram that would have been used to pick colors for maps like this. Particularly notable in this map are the “3D”-looking representations of elevation data, which were based on federal datasets such as digital line graph (DLG) and digital elevation model (DEM), and were a hallmark feature of Arc/INFO that allowed for visual representations of surfaces.

##### Applied Geographics, Inc. [Massachusetts coastal towns](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:2227s1511) \[ca. 1990-1999]

This page is a print-out of an important step in mapmaking, which is laying out the important informative elements of a map (title block, credits, north arrow, scale bar, etc.) so that they don’t interfere with the content of the map. Computerized map production meant it was trivial to create visualizations of the same dataset for different locations, seen here with the same types of information displayed for various coastal towns of Massachusetts. This page only shows the outlines of the towns and the orange and green marks show an unnamed editor's ideas for where the title block and credits, respectively, could be located for each map.

##### Louis Day ***Map - B. Property at Floral Park. Nassau County, N.Y. The Floral Park Corporation***. (1919)

Mashpee land use change 1971-1990

1991

This map shows the ways that land use changed over two decades in the Massachusetts town of Mashpee. As with other maps of this time period, the map is in many ways secondary in importance to the data table of land use statistics printed on the bottom of the sheet. One notable part of this map is that the cartographers took time to create two “Change” views that can visually help guide a viewer towards an understanding of the difference between two moments in time.

##### C.R.B.; Edmund S. Davis ***Detail Plan. Section 4. Boylston Street Subway. Typical Cross Section***. (1913)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/map 1 (1).png" class="" >}}

Since their introduction, blueprints have become synonymous with construction drawings. They are durable enough for use at construction sites, can be drawn on, and easily reproduced and distributed to the many trades involved in a construction project. This detailed plan shows a section elevation view of the subway tunnels at the MBTA Green Line Boylston Street subway station (the section clarifies how tight the space is between the two subway tracks). The creator was Edmund S. Davis, who served as chief engineer of the Boston Transit Department from 1909 through 1920. 

##### Robert B. Bellamy ***Plan of Property of Society Har Moriah Cemetery Corporation, Hyde Park and West Roxbury Mass*** (1931)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/map 3.png" >}}

In 1931, Dorchester-based surveyor Robert B. Bellamy produced a survey for the Society Har Moriah Cemetery Corporation. The plan shows multiple lots at the Cemetery’s site at the Hyde Park / West Roxbury border. These two versions of the plan demonstrate the blueprint process – the image on the left is the original drawing, created with dark ink on a translucent paper. The blueprint process produced a reverse image of white lines and text on a blue background. An infinite number of prints could be produced in much less time than hand copying and the prints could be marked up, rolled, and otherwise handled without impacting the original. The prints also were difficult to modify without being obvious so they often served as “record copies.”   

##### Frederic Endicott ***Map of Three Mile Island in Lake Winnipesaukee Owned by the Appalachian Mountain Club. Together with its Nearest Neighbors.*** (1902)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/map 1.png" caption="" >}}

Surveyor Frederic Endicott loved mountaineering and was an active member of the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) where he assumed various roles, including "Councilor of Topography" (the AMC also has his photography collection). In the 1900s, the area around Lake Winnipesaukee was remote and undeveloped; Endicott helped in documenting the transfer of lots on the lake’s Three Mile Island owned by Mrs. Eastman and Mr. Lawrence to the Club. Today, the island is a highly popular resort for camping.

##### ***Map of the Pan American R.R. and its connections***.

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/map 3 (3).png" class="" >}}

The Pan American R.R. was started in 1891 by a group of Boston investors who sought to build a railroad line from Victoria, Texas to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The decorative title block suggests that this map was designed to interest potential investors. However, the railroad never took off – only 10 miles of track were completed before the investors ran out of money. The map displays the proposed route in the context of other railroad lines in Texas. This print shows a standard mode of editing prints – a red pencil. 

##### Viaux, F. H.; Whitney, William H. ***Suggestions for the Laying Out of the Lands of the Charles River Embankment Co. and Others.*** (1888)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/map 3 (1).png" class="" >}}

In the 1880s and 1890s, the rapid development of the Back Bay on the Boston side of the Charles River excited land developers about the possibilities of mirroring the Back Bay on the Cambridge side. One such project was proposed by Charles Davenport of the Charles River Embankment Company. Inspired by a visit to Havana, Cuba, Davenport hired Frederick H. Viaux to design a series of studies for a new residential neighborhood on what had largely been swamp land.  This design featured an esplanade fronting roads and blocks with multiple rotaries. This particular project never came to fruition – the developer went bankrupt – and the neighborhood lay dormant for a time until M.I.T. moved there from Back Bay in the 1910s and developed its current campus alongside what is now Memorial Drive.
