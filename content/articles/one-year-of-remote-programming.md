We've been online only for over a year now, and while we've missed being able to offer our exhibits and events in person, we now have a lot of resources for you to use at home!

### Bending Lines

Our exhibit [Bending Lines](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/) opened last year online, instead of in person, after the pandemic interrupted [America Transformed](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/25). Both exhibits exist online now, as do [all our former exhibits](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits)! Because Bending Lines has been online for its whole existence, all the programming around the exhibit is also available online as well. This includes our series [Angles on Bending Lines](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/events/), which is a guest conversation series that takes a critical look at maps and data.

We will actually be continuing Angles on Bending Lines this spring with a new series of talks! Stay tuned for more information. In the meantime, check out our curator Garrett Dash Nelson's talk with Judith Tyner who coined the term "persuasive cartography," the starting point of Bending Lines:

### Atlascope

Right before COVID, we started bringing our [Atlascope tool](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org) to branch libraries of the BPL to show patrons how to use it to do historical geography research. You can play with Atlascope here or click through to the full version:

Not only have we been to nearly a dozen branches at this point, many virtually, we've also done several fun trivia nights themed around our urban atlases.

Check out our first trivia night and play along:
