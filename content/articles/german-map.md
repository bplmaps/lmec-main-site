This map of the United States, at first glance, doesn't appear to share information for American viewers; if those viewers can read German, of course. But look closely and you'll see why this map is a little more than just educational.

This 1950s map of the United States was not created for an American audience, but was instead created by the US Information Service. Much has been written about the United States Information Agency, an Eisenhower-agency started in 1953, but not a lot has been written about its earlier cousin, the Information *Service*.

Prior to surrender in World War II, the Office of War Information was established, which had goals both at home and overseas. Visibly, overseas, the OWI's work took the form of the Voice of America, modelled on the wartime operations of the BBC. After the War, the OWI was disbanded and replaced with a new ad-hoc Information Service under the Truman administration; the Smith-Mundt Act authorized the first peacetime American propaganda operation to "present a 'full and fair picture' of the United States to the world at large"[^1].

At the end of World War II, America's economy was booming, but across the Atlantic, the majority of Europe found itself in dire straits. The United States had exited its long-held tradition of isolationism and wielded its newfound military superiority over the rest of the world, and in particular Europe. Rebecca Boehling writes that, at the end of the War, much of Europe felt a need to relativize American military superiority, choosing to fall back on their understanding of America as a "culturally primitive, although technologically advanced, money-driven, amorphous, mass society," with that effect perhaps seen in the most complex ways by the Germans[^2]. Upon American occupation of West Germany post-War, it was seen as necessary for America to reshape the Germans' understanding of American society -- as Boehling writes, American understanding was that all elements of German culture had played a role in the Nazification of the country, and new values needed to be instilled. The Service was designed to reach into Europe, establishing libraries and creating publications with far-reaching influence -- Leo Bogart's study into the USIA describes its predecessors activities and anecdotally just how much reach the service had.

The map, entirely in German, showcases key industries, landmarks or historical events in each state. In Massachusetts, for instance, Harvard and MIT are listed, as is Provincetown, depicted with an artist at an easel. In other states, industry is highlighted; cotton and coal are highlighted as two key industries of Alabama, for example. The map includes broad information about the USA on the whole to the bottom right, describing factual information about the country, noting the differences between the regions but emphasizing a common link between all the states regardless. This map was likely one of USIS' publications distributed in a Cold War divided Germany, aiming, as the Smith-Mundt Act intended, to provide a "full and fair picture" of the United States to the world at large.
