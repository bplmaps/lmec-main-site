At first glance, this 1950s map of the United States, *[Illustrierte karte der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp17t)*, doesn't appear to share much information for American viewers (unless, of course, those viewers can read German). A closer look reveals [[[can you add something more specific about what it reveals? e.g., reveals a lot about midcentury U.S.-German geopolitics, postwar internationalism, etc.]]]---but to fully understand it requires a bit of historical context. 

In the summer of 1942, the Roosevelt administration established the Office of War Information (OWI), a pro-war propaganda agenct that operated both within the U.S. and abroad. Among the OWI's goals was the overseas management of the [Voice of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America), a U.S. state-owned radio broadcaster modelled on the wartime operations of the British Broadcasting Corporation. After the War, the Truman administration disbanded the OWI, replacing it with a new ad-hoc propaganda department called the United States Information Service (USIS). The Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 authorized the first peacetime American propaganda operation to "present a ‘full and fair picture’ of the United States to the world at large,"[^1] and shortly after taking office in 1953, the Eisenhower administration would transform the somewhat informal USIS into the United States Information Agency.

At the end of World War II, America's economy was booming, but across the Atlantic, the majority of Europe found itself in dire straits. The United States had exited its long-held tradition of isolationism and wielded its newfound military superiority over the rest of the world, and in particular Europe. The historian Rebecca Boehling writes that at the end of the War, much of Europe felt a need to relativize American military superiority, choosing to fall back on their understanding of America as a "culturally primitive, although technologically advanced, money-driven, amorphous, mass society," with that effect perhaps seen in the most complex ways by the Germans.[^2]

Upon American occupation of West Germany post-War, it was seen as necessary for America to reshape the Germans' understanding of American society -- as Boehling writes, American understanding was that all elements of German culture had played a role in the Nazification of the country, and new values needed to be instilled. The Service was designed to reach into Europe, establishing libraries and creating publications with far-reaching influence -- Leo Bogart's study into the USIA describes its predecessors activities and anecdotally just how much reach the service had.

The map, entirely in German, showcases key industries, landmarks or historical events in each state. In Massachusetts, for instance, Harvard and MIT are listed, as is Provincetown, depicted with an artist at an easel. In other states, industry is highlighted; cotton and coal are highlighted as two key industries of Alabama, for example. The map includes broad information about the USA on the whole to the bottom right, describing factual information about the country, noting the differences between the regions but emphasizing a common link between all the states regardless. This map was likely one of USIS' publications distributed in a Cold War divided Germany, aiming, as the Smith-Mundt Act intended, to provide a "full and fair picture" of the United States to the world at large.
