> *On April 4, we hosted **From The Vault — Revolution at Scale: New Netherlands, the Hudson, and Albany.***

Our new exhibition, [Terrains of Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/), explores the American Revolution through the lens of geographic scale rather than chronology or individual figures. This week’s From the Vault examines another colonial city—Albany—revealing what we can learn as we zoom in from empire to town.

#### Arnold Colom, ***[Pas caarte van Nieu Nederlandt](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462s79h)*** (1656)

This is a map designed to get you somewhere not to tell you what the place will be like when you arrive. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462s79h) reveals its purpose in the rhumb lines crisscrossing the map like a spider web. The lines would supported navigation when a compass was placed on the map. Notice the land is almost entirely empty of detail except for a few marked locations. 

The Dutch initially envisioned creating trading outposts rather than settlements in North America. Albany originated as an outpost, evolved into a settlement organized by a manor system controlled by individual patrons and eventually became the village of Beverwyck in 1652 about 100 years after this map was created.

The Hudson River runs like a spine down the length of New York State. The river provided a place for hunting, fishing, horticulture, and trade for indigenous people for thousands of years before Henry Hudson sailed up the waterway in 1609. 

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161879t) comes from Michel René Hilliard D’Auberteuil’s 1782 Essais historiques et politiques sur les Anglo-Américains. The text also included portraits of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and John Hancock. The inclusion of this map demonstrates that the Hudson River was as important in the Revolution as these patriot luminaries.

#### Robert Yates, [Plan of the city of Albany about the year 1770 : from the original survey](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:kw52q9272) (1850)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7p88jj38j/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Albany became a British colony in 1664. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:kw52q9272) demonstrates how settlement was pressed along the Hudson River. Like other colonial cities, many of these streets still survive today. Time traveling 18th century Albanians would probably still be able to navigate from Orange Street to Beaver Street.

#### Christoph Heinrich Korn, [Plan von den operationen der Koeniglichen Armee unter dem General Sir William Howe : in Neuyorck und Ost-Neujerseÿ gegen die Americaner unter comando des General Washington, vom 12. October bis 28. November. 1776, wobeÿ vorzüglich die affaire beÿ White Plains am 28. October vorgestellt wird](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462w91d) (1777)

The Hudson, or North River, was a point of fixation for King George III. He firmly believed, based on his examination of [maps like this one ](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462w91d)from a distance, the British army could seize control of the river and separate New England from the southern colonies. Just as the king was obsessed with this plan, the Patriots were similarly convinced it was possible. 

George Washington wrote to Major General Israel Putnam in December 1777: 

> “The importance of the North \[Hudson] River in the present contest and the necessity of defending it, are subjects which have been so frequently and so fully discussed, and are so well understood, that is is unnecessary to enlarge upon them. These facts at once appear, when it is considered that it runs through a whole state; that it is the only passage by which the enemy from New York, or any part of our coast, can ever hope to cooperate with an army from Canada; that the possession of its indispensably essential to preserve the communication between the eastern, middle, and southern states; and further, that upon its security, in a great measure, depend our chief supplies of flour for the subsistence of such forces, as we may have occasion for, in the course of the war, either in the eastern or northern departments, or in the country lying high up on the west side of it.”

#### H.H. Lloyd, ***[Telegraph chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149w21m)*** (1858)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149w22w/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149w21m) shows the track of the great submarine Atlantic telegraph in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Europe, and north Africa, as well as submarine cables, steamship routes, and proposed lines to be added at a later date. Included to accompany the chart are two double column articles of text: one accounts the invention and operation of the magnetic telegraph and the other is a description of the making and laying submarine telegraph cables. The laying of the Atlantic cable was one of the great international undertakings of the nineteenth century and would take the equivalent of billions of dollars, four failed attempts, and another 8 years after this map was published before it was completed.

#### Jean-Baptiste-Paul Touquet, ***[Chart shewing the tracks across the North Atlantic Ocean of Don Christopher Columbus](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6t053s69r)*** (1828)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:6t053s70h/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Sailing under the Spanish flag, Christopher Columbus voyaged from Europe across the North Atlantic to the West Indies and made four separate voyages departing from either Spain or Portugal. From his first voyage in 1492-93 to his final voyage in 1502-04, he visited many Caribbean islands, including the larger ones of Hispaniola, Cuba, and Jamaica, as well as the northern coast of South America. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6t053s69r), published in Paris in 1828, reconstructs the approximate routes of Columbus' trans-Atlantic passages, indicating his location by month and day. The patterns established in these early voyages, which used the predominant ocean currents and the Trade Winds, are the general routes followed by many from the Iberian peninsula and Africa's West Coast to the Caribbean.

#### Louis Désiré Léon Brault, Eduard Dumas-Vorzet, and C. Legros, ***[Océan Pacifique](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:zc77zv05s)*** (1880)

[This sheet](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:zc77zv05s) is from a set of 4 charts showing direction and strength of winds at different times of year. Each square represents 10 degrees latitude and longitude, and the wind-roses (vector diagrams) show the direction and strength of prevailing winds. The length and color of each point indicate the intensity and likelihood of the winds and the direction it points corresponds with the wind's positionality. For example, a dark red line with a bit of yellow at the end pointing to the SW would mean this area most often has strong winds (dark red) — or the occasional gentle breeze (yellow) — blowing towards the southwest. The small number inside the circle of each diagram states the number of recordings taken from that location.
