> We’re excited to introduce A**lex Jones** to the LMEC team as our new Learning Resource Specialist in the Education department! Alex joined us this June and has an extensive history in library and museum work. We sat down with Alex to learn more about his interest in the American Revolution, his favorite digital tools, and his “must see item” from *[Terrains of Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/)*.

##### ***Alex, we’re so excited to have you on board here at the Leventhal Map & Education Center. Tell us a little bit about your background—what led up to your new role with us?***

My background is in libraries and museums. I’ve worked at the Old State House, Ford’s Theatre, the National Park Service and, most recently, as a project director for a community archiving program. I’ve had the opportunity to speak with tens of thousands of people in this line of work. A lot of those conversations were, “where’s the bathroom” (always a valid question!), but some were about heavier topics or what these places mean to people. I’ve been fortunate to learn from so many visitors, coworkers, and mentors. Geography, place, and public memory have always been at the core of my work, and I’m excited for the opportunity to focus on these themes in a more intentional way and support K-12 educators.

##### ***Do you have a favorite of the digital programs and tools we have available to the public right now?***

I’m a huge fan of [Atlascope](https://www.atlascope.org/). For the Boston area, Atlascope feels close to a time machine. Before coming to the LMEC team, I’d used it to teach undergraduate students different strategies for researching communities displaced by urban renewal.

My spiel would go something like this:

> *“If we were to zoom in to one home, these fire insurance maps could show us the street address, what the building is made of, and who owned it. Can we find out who else lived here through U.S. Census records? Are there photos of this neighborhood that we can geolocate by the shape and make of the buildings? What businesses were nearby, and can we find old newspaper ads that tell us what they kept in stock?”*

These maps can help students see a historic map in three dimensions, both on its own or as a starting point for something deeper. Sometimes I also just like looking at Atlascope until something catches my eye and I learn something new. Stepping away from it is usually the hardest part for me!

##### ***You’re starting in the middle of [Terrains of Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/). We’ve come to know you have quite an interest in the American Revolution! Tell us what you think makes this historical period relevant to the current day.***

When I think about the American Revolution, especially in Boston, I always come back to this idea of uncertainty. I saw this meme that said “I’m tired of living through interesting times” and I think that would also resonate with someone living in Boston in 1775. Living through that period must have felt deeply chaotic at times. We can chart cause and effect in hindsight, but everyone is making choices that make sense in the moment.

One reason I love Terrains is that it presents how the landscape shapes these choices. People with rebel sympathies lived right next to loyalists in Boston, which was densely populated for a town in the colonies. British soldiers and their families also become a part of this urban fabric. “Revolution” might mean something very different to one person than it does to their neighbors. Maps with battle lines create this clear-cut sense of “us” vs. “them,” but the reality is always messier. People were forced to decide which side of the front lines feel safer for them, which is a near impossible choice. Everyday people were shaping the map without even realizing it.

There’s [one map](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/city/the-seat-of-war/) in the exhibit that sticks with me. It shows[ ](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/city/the-seat-of-war/)American militias from across New England marching toward Boston. I’d guess most of these people had never been to Boston, but they risked everything to aid this cause that transcended any one place, person, or event. So I think if there’s any lesson for us, it’s that history is the product of our choices, and the choices we make to help our communities are usually the ones that work out.

##### ***You’re starting in the middle of [Processing Place: How Computers and Cartographers Redrew our World.](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/) Are there any parts of the current exhibition that you’re especially drawn to?***

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:f47554722/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" caption="Boston Redevelopment Authority, Illustrative site plan: Government Center urban renewal area, Massachusetts R-35 (1968)" class="figure-left" >}}

As someone who has always been fascinated in watching the processes of things, I find the tools used to create maps the most fascinating, especially since they can communicate so much about the social realities present when maps were being created with those tools. With the assorted drafting tools in the *[Transforming Tools](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/catalogue/04-transforming-tools/)* portion of this exhibit, I found it interesting that those tools lend to a knowledge base that was not only based on cognitive expertise, but a physical component as well with analogue methods of drawing maps.

I was also strongly drawn to the [Government Center urban renewal area map](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/catalogue/04-transforming-tools/4.3/) plan because of the Boston Redevelopment Authority’s choice to utilize bold colors. However, what I didn’t know until reading the caption, was that those colors were an intentional choice in order to distract from the fact that the neighborhoods that were being developed in were typically nonwhite and lower-income neighborhoods. That fact that color on maps could be used to market a certain reality was something I hadn’t considered before. Color as a socially conscious choice is very interesting to me as an anthropology student.

##### ***What is your earliest memory of maps?***

{{< figure src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fe/06/46/fe064619a72ae33f0b6d514cdfdf5fb1.jpg" caption="Star map projection from the Treasure Planet Map in Disney's &#x22;Treasure Planet&#x22;" class="figure-right" >}}

My earliest memory of maps, that I can think of right now, would be the [planet map](https://www.therpf.com/forums/attachments/tpmr11-png.1078169/) to The Treasure Planet in Treasure Planet. Treasure Planet is a futuristic Disney retelling of the Treasure Island novel about pirates on a quest for gold with a young boy as the main character. I distinctly remember this map because when the main character pressed on a circle engraved on this mysterious sphere, a three-dimensional sphere-shaped holographic projection of a star chart appeared! I found it fascinating because each celestial body had its own unique iconography—if there was a key for the map, I imagine it would be extensive.

I always thought it would be interesting to imagine that the map was also trying to convey information about this universe’s social dynamics based on the map’s creator thoughts on certain planets. Perhaps some of the map icons are meant to signify danger within this culture, and even then, that danger could be 100% subjective or based upon certain power dynamics between the map creator’s cultures and others.

##### ***We know you’ve just gotten here, but do you have a favorite map that you’ve found in the collections during your initial browsing?***

This may be biased, but the [Atlas of the City of Quincy, Norfolk County, Mass: from official plans and actual surveys (1897)](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rx916j21s) by Geo. W. Stadly & Co. It is not a traditional map (it’s actually a fire insurance atlas), but I enjoyed flipping through this atlas and recognizing (or learning) certain facts about my hometown.

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:sf26c112m/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" >}}

For starters, one of the atlas pages has evidence to suggest that the reason for Faxon park or Faxon Commons, the apartment complex, being named so in the current day, was due to the prevalent land ownership of H.H. Faxon back in the late 1800s. I found out through some research, that H.H. Faxon was actually a descendant of an early colonialist, [Thomas Faxon, who had arrived to the area from England back in the 1640s](https://ufpc.org/ufpc-vignettes/f/the-faxon-family) and created a family dynasty of land owning. I was also able to find out that the property that my family’s home resides on was once owned by a Mrs. G. T. Bigelow. Upon further research, I found out this former property owner shares the same first initials and last name as [George Tyler Bigelow](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:73666f734), the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court from 1860 to 1867, who resided in Quincy for a short time.
