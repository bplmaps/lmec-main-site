### Section 112 in the Boston Region: Universities, Hospitals, and Urban Renewal

Should wealthy nonprofits like universities and hospitals be tax exempt because they serve the public good? Or do they draw on public resources while driving up rents and primarily serving a wealthy elite? Questions like this periodically pop up in the pages of the *Boston Globe* as the merits of tax exemption [are debated](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/04/07/metro/should-massachusetts-allow-municipalities-require-nonprofits-make-payments-lieu-taxes/) and payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) are [tallied up](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/09/11/boston-tallies-nonprofits-cash-payments-but-some-critics-say-they-still-fall-short/QCetjVISjgQUKmDDhF7VAN/story.html?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results). Today, there is growing discontent over the leading role that tax-exempt universities and medical institutions have taken in urban development all over the country recent decades, transforming the neighborhoods around them into exclusive enclaves.[^1]

Struggles over the influence of powerful nonprofits on the neighborhoods around them are longstanding. During the 1950s and 1960s, buoyed by Cold War research dollars and the expansion of college enrollment (due in part to the coming of age of the baby boomers), universities in Massachusetts and all over the country pursued physical expansion.[^2] Hospitals also pursued expansion and consolidation to modernize their facilities and win national prestige.[^3]

#### Section 1 Title

In the early 1960s, the city of Boston undertook a wide-ranging urban renewal program intended, in part, to increase the city's tax base and to attract high-income residents to the city.[^4] The Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) was reorganized to take on city planning functions, and a national-renewed development administrator, Ed Logue, was recruited from New Haven.[^5] Although Logue and Mayor Colins promised to "plan with people," Boston's fiscal situation was especially acute after it nearly went into bankruptcy in 1959.[^6] Collins tasked Logue to "bring prosperity back to Boston with the politicians and business community working together."[^7] Cambridge faced a similarly tough fiscal situation.[^8]

Because of the tax-exempt status of universities and hospitals, their expansion in the 1950s and 1960s was in tension with the efforts of planners and politicians to raise the city's tax base. "Section 112" was an early attempt to align incentives between universities and hospitals through urban renewal legislation. Under Section 112, if universities bought land in or near urban renewal projects, the price of purchasing this land could be counted as a local "grant-in-aid," triggering a 2-1 match by the Federal government. Credits could be "pooled" across a city, meaning that a project in one place could benefit the overall renewal effort. While this legislation was spearheaded by University of Chicago boosters, figures from MIT and other local universities were also involved early on.[^9] Starting in 1959, universities could produce Section 112 credits, and in 1961 the legislation was modified to include hospitals.[^10]

But Section 112 did not totally bridge the gap between cities and universities. University expansion would still be tax exempt, after all, and contributing to funding urban renewal projects and closing the city's budget deficit were not exactly the same. Moreover, urban renewal projects faced increasing resistance from communities sick and tired of displacement and discrimination -- and Section 112 projects were no exception. As we will see below, several famous struggles in Boston and Cambridge were connected to Section 112 credits in some way.

In order to tally potential Section 112 Credits, a 1962 study of Boston called the *Levi Report*, named after its author, was created in cooperation with representatives of many of Boston's leading educational and healthcare institutions known as the "Mayor's College Committee". The *Levi Report* indicated that over $30 million in institutional expenditures in the city had the potential to trigger a $60 million federal match -- nearly doubling the size of Boston's "$90-million-dollar plan" announced the year before.[^11] These figures did not include potential projects in Cambridge or elsewhere.

But in the end, as far as I have found,[^12] only three projects ever generated Section 112 credits in the Boston region: Cambridge's Kendall Square as well as Boston's South Cove and Fenway. All three projects faced community resistance which would significantly affect their scale and scope. Examining urban renewal from the perspective of Section 112 and its opponents reminds us that universities have long played a role in shaping the neighborhoods around them.

#### Kendall Square

Today, Kendall Square is a well-known place, synonymous with the Boston region's innovation economy, like Route 128 was before. In the 1950s, suburban research parks began to sprout along what would become known as America's "tech highway", a suburban strip that became an international symbol of innovation while Silicon Valley was still best known for its peaches.[^13]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fn107c18s/full/pct:20/0/default.jpg" caption="The \"golden semicircle\" of Greater Boston." class="figure-center" >}}

But Kendall Square was not born yesterday. MIT began planning nearby Technology Square beginning in the late 1950s in collaboration with Cabot, Cabot and Forbes, the developer of many suburban office parks along Route 128. The idea was to bring prosperity back to what was then a declining industrial area.

Many Bostonians know that {{<popup img-src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:wd377627v/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg" bib-src="https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:wd377626k" target="blank">}}NASA built an Electronics Research Center (ERC) in Kendall Square in the 1960s.{{</popup>}}It has been (incorrectly) rumored NASA planned to build Mission Control there: according to the story, if not for the intervention of Texan Lyndon Johnson, it would have been "Boston," not "Houston, we have a problem!"[^14]

What is less well-known is the role that Section 112 credits played in the site. In 1963, with John F. Kennedy in the White House, and Ted Kennedy in the Senate, NASA was searching New England for a site to locate the ERC. Robert Rowland, a planner who worked at the time for the BRA on the Washington Square project, began to look for potential ERC locations and landed on Kendall Square -- the place where he parked his car to catch the subway to work. Preparing a plan on spec with a few associates, Rowland suggested paying for the redevelopment of the site using Section 112 credits generated by MIT.

Not only would the NASA center bring high-paying jobs to Cambridge directly, but building the ERC was intended to spur private commercial development in what later came to be known as the{{<popup img-src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7p88g262c/166,886,1060,859/full/0/default.jpg" bib-src="https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:1c18gz05k" target="blank">}}"golden triangle"{{</popup>}} directly to the south of the project area. Development of this area would supposedly more than offset the fiscal loss from removing the NASA parcels from Cambridge's tax rolls.[^15] Boston, too, made overtures to NASA to site the ERC.[^16]

Although the ERC was supposed to be built in phases, the{{<popup img-src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:wd377611z/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg" bib-src="https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:wd377610p" target="blank">}}first phase{{</popup>}}was not even completed as planned. Starting in 1968, the spigot of funds for building the center was closed. After three consecutive years without available construction funding, in late 1969 NASA announced it would close the partially built ERC altogether.[^17] Purportedly, this was an act of revenge by President Nixon against the state of Massachusetts, another rumor that is difficult to prove or disprove.[^18]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:zs25z501k/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg" caption="NASA employees leave meeting after announcement that their jobs are being phased out in closing of Cambridge NASA Electronics Research Center, from [Boston Public Library Arts Department](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:zs25z5009)" class="figure-center" >}}

Throughout the early 1970s, a complex multi-sided struggle ensued between various parties as to the best development path for Kendall Square.[^19] All the while, the price of the renewal project went up and up. Cambridge planners expected the whole cost to be covered by Section 112 Credits. From the initial $6 million in credits, 1973 estimates indicated that MIT would certify over $17 million[^20] -- something the school was unwilling and unable to do.

In the end, MIT wouldn't have to certify any more credits at all. The project was entirely funded by national legislation. President Gerald Ford, while on Christmas vacation in Vale, Colorado, signed a bill that increased national lending limits for mobile homes.[^21] The second section of the act specified that Cambridge, MA would not have to pay any more than it already had for the urban renewal of Kendall Square -- that is, any more than the Section 112 credits that had already been certified.[^22] While debates about the site's use would continue, the city was off the hook for funding its transformation.

#### South Cove

In Boston's South Cove, the main protagonists in the struggle over Section 112 credits were the Tufts-New England Medical Center (T-NEMC) and Boston's Chinatown community. T-NEMC had begun to buy parcels in the area in the early 1950s, when the imminent construction of Boston's central artery both depressed housing prices and cleared a path for the T-NEMC to expand without moving to the suburbs. At the time, the T-NEMC (whose name would change various times) was comprised of several separate institutions in the process of combining, consolidating, and making a bid for national prestige.[^23]

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/NYCRR_Headlights_Cover_196502XX.png" caption="New York Central employee magazine Headlights from February 1965 showing an aerial photograph of the completed Boston Extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike, from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NYCRR_Headlights_Cover_196502XX.png)" class="figure-left" >}}

In the early 1960s, the T-NEMC's new planner Herman Field -- who had been part of a dramatic Cold War episode in which he had been held in a Polish prison for five years -- used the promise of Section 112 credits to draw the attention of the BRA, which otherwise had bigger fish to fry.[^24] Footing much of the planning bill itself, the T-NEMC's expansion promised to generate nearly $5.5 millions of Section 112 credits for Boston.[^25]

Particularly appealing was possibility of generating credits from purchases made before 1957, which normally would have been impossible due to time limits on back-dating credits. But the South Cove was not the only urban renewal project in the area. The nearby New York Streets project, one of the earliest in the city, had already been approved by 1955, and so the BRA and the T-NEMC attempted to claim credits from parcels purchased as far back as 1950.[^26]

New York Streets was Boston's first teardown urban renewal project initiated by Mayor Hynes, along the lines of the West End. Although the New York Streets project initially had nothing to do with the T-NEMC, it was close enough to potentially generate credits. According to the urban renewal guidelines, school purchases could generate credits if they were within a quarter of a mile of an urban renewal project (the rule would be changed to half a mile in 1966 at the behest of MIT).[^27] Since the actual work on the New York Streets project was mostly complete in 1962, this would have generated nearly $2 million in cash for the city's renewal program.

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:4m90hd303/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg" caption="*Relationship of TNEMC development plan area to New York streets land assembly and redevelopment project*, from [LMEC Collections](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:ks65kv52b)" class="figure-right" >}}

The T-NEMC and the BRA tried to quickly get an institutional plan, as well as a plan for the South Cove, approved by the Boston City Council in the winter of 1962 and 1963. But the plan was delayed by the opposition of the skeptical Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA), which spoke out against the plan until a memorandum of understanding was signed between the BRA and the CCBA.[^28] As late as summer 1963, the BRA still hoped to generate credits from the New York Streets project, and even upped their claims to around $1.4 million. But, facing a shortage of appropriations nationally, the New York Streets project eventually closed out without any Section 112 funding.[^29] The South Cove, on the other hand, did generate credits -- although not enough to subsidize other projects around Boston.[^30]

The T-NEMC's expansion has been controversial among residents of Chinatown. While the memorandum of understanding between the CCBA and the BRA was an important landmark, it had several weaknesses. It only covered a small area south of Kneeland and east of Harrison, and even worse, it was ambiguous about the status of parcels owned by T-NEMC but rented out to residents. These were precisely those parcels which, if repurposed for hospital use, would generate Section 112 credits. Indeed, these very parcels would become the focal point of conflict between the Chinese community and T-NEMC as the hospital moved to realize its expansion plans form the late 1960s onwards. Younger activists in the community would chafe at the paternalistic stance of the CCBA, and their collaboration with the BRA, advocating for a more direct style of confrontation in keeping with other "neighborhood revolts" in the city.[^31]

One parcel that was certified to generate Section 112 credits later generated notoriety in the "Parcel C" struggle of the early 1990s. After years of disuse, it was slated to be turned into a parking garage, and citizen groups protested.[^32] After a protracted struggle, control of the parcel was given to the CCBA, and eventually it was redeveloped as the Metropolitan Condominiums, which includes affordable units and community space.

#### Fenway

Fenway, Boston's largest pot of potential Section 112 Credits, represented a complex web of difficult-to-disentangle institutions. The largest potential generators of credits were Northeastern University, Harvard Medical School and its Affiliated Hospitals, and BU. Lined up against these institutions ­-- Harvard in particular -- was the neighborhood of Mission Hill, organized around Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow, also known as the Mission Church.

Residents of Mission Hill were already angry about the Whitney Street renewal project, a non-federally subsided urban renewal project planned in the late 1950s that built high-rises for middle class families, displacing residents of the area.[^33] When plans for the Massachusetts Mental Health Center to expand across Fenwood road were announced (Section 112 credits: $697,000),[^34] residents of Mission Hill marched to the Boston Commons *en masse* to stand silent vigil in front of the State Capitol.[^35]

While that project was cancelled, the struggle was not over. In fact, the *Levi* *Report* proposed taking most of the land between the Riverway and Huntington Avenue to build new facilities for Harvard and its affiliated hospitals (Section 112 credits: $8+ million). Planners viewed this as a compromise, as in 1958 an institutional planning group had called for expansion to the southeast, across Huntington Avenue, and into the heart of Mission Hill.[^36] But local residents did not view this as a compromise. Logue had promised them that "planning with people" meant the whole area would be completely excluded from urban renewal if they didn't want it[^37] -- and houses along Fenwood Road and Francis Street were considered part of the community.

Under pressure from the Christian Science Church, which wanted to push its Christian Science Plaza forward as soon as possible (it was also part of the Fenway project), as well as the threat of expiring credits, the BRA was determined to get its plan through city council before the end of 1965. In the end, that meant cutting the Harvard expansion out of the plan entirely, sacrificing some credits to get the Fenway plan approved. During a public hearing in 1965, Logue saw fit to "emphasize, as strongly as possible" that the area southwest of Francis Street was not included in the renewal area.[^38] Nevertheless, the project -- which still consisted of $7 million credits from Northeastern and smaller sums from other institutions -- was criticized as "artificially contrived to include as many '112' credits as possible."[^39]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:s1785h00n/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg" caption="Student addressing crowd during rally in support of SDS members at Harvard, from [Boston Public Library Arts Department](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:s1785g993)" class="figure-left" >}}

But the story did not end after Section 112 credits were out of the picture. Harvard and its Affiliated Hospitals attempted expansion on their own, buying up properties in the same area over several years, and serving eviction notices were to residents in March 1969. This met vigorous resistance from the community, organized, in part by students from Harvard. In the Harvard protests of April 1969, in which students briefly took over the University Hall, among the 6 demands, one was to stop the med-school expansion in Mission Hill.[^40]

While Harvard's Affiliated Hospital Center was eventually built as Brigham and Women's Hospital, the coalition between students and Mission Hill residents force Harvard recon with residents' demands. The houses on Fenwood Road and Francis Street were preserved. On the site of the former Good Shepheard's convent, the Roxbury Tenants of Harvard, as the resident group came to be known, worked with Harvard to build the Mission Park housing development, which opened in the late 1970s, consisting of both high-rises and townhouses. In so doing the residents gave up some of their leverage against Harvard: in a related controversy, when Harvard wanted to build a new "Medical Area Total Energy Plant", it proved difficult to organize effective neighborhood opposition concerns about pollution because Mission Park would also benefit from the power source. While "the power plant was eventually built... so was Mission Park."[^41]

### Conclusion: Section 112 and PILOTs

Telling the stories of Section 112 shows how universities and hospitals have long been involved in efforts to reshape urban space. In so doing, they have been constrained by the activism of residents, funding considerations, and the interests of other organizations. While Section 112 was an attempt to align institutional and city planning, organized citizen groups successfully pushed back, sometimes resulting in new housing and greater community control.

Depending on their strategies, organizations used the promise of credits in different ways. In the Boston cases, institutions used the promise of credits to solicit attention cooperation from the BRA with varying degrees of success, whereas in Cambridge the city wanted to leverage the credits far beyond MIT's willingness to do so. But in all over these cases, the promise of credits and their contestation has shaped the form of the city today.
