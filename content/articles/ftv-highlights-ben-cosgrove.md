> Ben Cosgrove is a traveling composer-performer whose “compelling and beautiful” instrumental music explores themes of landscape, place, and environment. He has performed in every U.S. state but Delaware, collaborated with groups ranging from rock bands to research scientists, and held residencies and fellowships with institutions including Acadia National Park, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, White Mountain National Forest, Harvard University, Middlebury College, the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the New England National Scenic Trail, NASA, and the Sitka Center for Art & Ecology. Ben’s fourth studio album, [The Trouble With Wilderness](https://bencosgrove.bandcamp.com/album/the-trouble-with-wilderness), an evocation of different expressions of nature and wildness within the built environment, was released in 2021. It has been the subject of an episode of the NHPR show Outside/In, was deemed one of the spring’s best new releases by WBUR, and has been called “beautiful and fascinating” (The Maine Edge), “instant relief” (The Boston Globe) “deeply impressive” (Independent Clauses) and “immediately evocative and fully arresting… brim\[ming] with technical mastery and emotional capital” (Seven Days). In addition to his solo work, Ben has performed and recorded with a long list of artists that includes Ghost of Paul Revere, GoldenOak, Darlingside, Max García Conover, and many more. To learn more, [visit his website](https://www.bencosgrove.com/).
