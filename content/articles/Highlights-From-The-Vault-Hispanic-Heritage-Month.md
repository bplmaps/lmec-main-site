> On October 13, we hosted From The Vault: Hispanic Heritage Month! From The Vault is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Map Center staff. For this edition of the series, we looked at a few objects from our collections that explore Hispanic heritage.

### Boston Redevelopment Authority, *[Boston's top 6 foreign languages spoken at home](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fn53g "Boston's top 6 foreign languages spoken at home")* (2010)

Based on survey data from 2006-2010, this Boston Redevelopment Authority map estimates Boston’s top 6 foreign languages spoken at home. Spanish appears to be spoken in a majority of the tracts.

### Ernest Dudley Chase, [The good neighbor pictorial map of South America](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fn10p "The good neighbor pictorial map of South America") (1942)

Cartographer (and Winchester, MA resident) Ernest Dudley Chase drew and published many pictorial maps in his day. Here, Chase emphasized architectural sites, people important to South America’s history -see Simón Bolívar at the lower right title block of the map-, and several other characteristics of South America, including the common flora and fauna within its states and territories.
