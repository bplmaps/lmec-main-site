> **On August 2, we hosted *From The Vault: The Menagerie - Maps, Animals, and Political Cartoons***\
> \
> *From The Vault* is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. This week we looked at the intersection between maps, animals, and political cartoons\*\*\*. \*\*\*Depicting geographic locations as animals or animalistic caricatures of people, these maps often leave viewers on their own to make sense of their meaning. While these maps may not be the most helpful for getting around, they provide a fascinating window into the opinions of their creators and the common moods of their time. Animal symbolism can transcend language and cultural barriers, and these cartographers used their medium to make a statement that can be understood even in the absence of words. As these maps were frequently created to spread propaganda, we considered the choices they made to manipulate public opinion, who their target audience was, and what stories they were ultimately trying to tell.\

> Content Warning: The maps shown may contains offensive imagery. The collections of the Leventhal Map & Education Center and the Boston Public Library are shaped by nearly two hundred years of collectors, archivists, curators, and library administrators deciding what documents qualified as historically significant objects. What you see on historic maps reflects the attitudes of the people who created these materials—and this includes attitudes that we today consider offensive for the ways in which they may show stereotypical, demeaning, or inaccurate depictions of people and places. In our educational programs, exhibitions, and public interpretation, we try to show how and why certain representations of the world came to provide the dominant visual language of cartography.

##### Johnson, Riddle & Co.** *[Horch! Horch! Die hunde bellen! : mit einer begleitschrift von Walter Emanuel = Hark! Hark! The dogs do bark!](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp01x)* : **with note by Walter Emanuel (1914)

In 1914 on the verge of WWI, Europe was a powder keg ready to blow. The humorous canine caricatures express countries’ attitudes towards the impending war: Germany is a dachshund chomping at the bit, Britain is a bulldog steadfastly warding off its territory, and France is an agitated poodle, reflecting the anxiety felt at the time. Published in London following the Battle of Mons in August, this map was produced by Johnson, Riddle, & Co. By portraying these nations in exaggerated animal forms, the map provides a playful yet pointed commentary on the tensions that precede war.

##### Frederic W. Rose [Serio-comic war map for the year 1877](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fk80z) (1877)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fk817/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

The motif of the octopus frequents propaganda beginning in the 19th century, depicting countries as grotesque tentacled beasts grasping at land. Falling under the umbrella of satirical maps, this 1887 serio-comic war map charts the political climate in Europe during the Russo-Turkish war, a conflict between the declining Ottoman Empire and the Russians, seeking to expand and regain lost territory. With tentacles encasing Crimea, encircling the Black sea, and ensnaring the Turks, this map negatively reflects Russia’s desire for expansion. By portraying the remaining countries as human, British cartographer F.W. Rose alienates Russia; viewers of the map feel disconnected from the many-armed octopus, therefore making it easier to fear and hate the Russians.

##### Ernest Dudley Chase [Historic Massachusetts : a travel map to help you feel at home in the Bay State ](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fn49w)(1964)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fn50n/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="" >}}

The state of Massachusetts commissioned this map as a way to advertise its tourist locations and important historical sites. It's interesting because each town on the map has its own fun fact, advertising at least one thing tourists can do in each city. Towns and cities that are not usually known as tourist destinations, such as Worcester, are highlighted here. The map's borders are also filled with other activities and sites in Massachusetts that couldn't be fit into the larger map. One example is Plymouth Rock, as seen on the bottom of the map. Although this map only dates back to 1964, it still reveals how people were informed of certain events/places to visit in their home state.  

##### Rand Avery Supply Co [New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad : Old Colony system](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp094) (1893)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fp10w/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="figure-left" >}}

This map advertises how people from Massachusetts, New York, New Haven, and Hartford can find their way to the coastal islands of Massachusetts: Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard. The map not only shows the times when visitors can catch the Old Colony Line to both islands, it also portrays an accurate map of the surrounding area, including public transportation and the locations it serves. The idea that one could get to the islands of Massachusetts from states away in the late 19th century would have been worth advertising and been a luxury to many! This is another example of a map giving people extra information in order to sell a product and make the company appear more trustworthy to the customer. 

##### John F Murphy [Bird's eye view of Boston Harbor and south shore to Provincetown showing steamboat routes](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3760753) (1901)

This map similarly advertises numerous steamboat and train routes of the early 20th century. All steamboat advertisements featured today opted to include practical elements in their advertisements by providing a functional map, but there are some key differences in the rest of their approach. This map chose to center its focus on the Boston Harbor and the water surrounding the greater Boston area. Not only does it successfully point out the bays specific to the waterside towns surrounding Boston, it also includes a rough estimate of the steamboat’s path to places like Provincetown and Plymouth after departing from the Boston Harbor.  

##### Geo H Walker and Co [Map showing the routes of The Winthrop Steamboat Co](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x059cc723) (1896)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:b85162086/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map from the Winthrop Steamboat Company uses a unique perspective to offer a practical and visually exciting map. To show the extensive area their steamboats reach, this company decided to incorporate a view of the areas of Boston and Winthrop, where the steamboats were based. From East Boston, Orient Heights, and Chelsea. blue lines show how the ports gave commuters easy access to the town of Winthrop! Commissioned in the late 19th century, this map shows the different modes of transportation that were relied upon.

##### Richard Edes Harrison [An aerial view of New York City showing how easily the weary traveler may reach the Herald Square Hotel wherein he will find the rest, comfort & hospitality to which he is entitled, even in this day and age](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:m039np67z) (1932)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:w6636m666/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

The map beautifully details Manhattan and even points out notable sites on the map, such as the Hudson River, Brooklyn Bridge, and the Empire State Building. However, it stands out in that it serves as both a functional map of NYC and as an advertisement for the Herald Square Hotel. The orange arrows leading to the hotel became the main focus of the map, in contrast with the black-and-white of the rest of the map. This was a captivating advertising tactic since maps were one of the main modes of finding and getting to events, entertainment spaces, restaurants, and other hospitality spaces- not only is this a functional map that could come in handy for a typical traveler, but it also subtly highlights its establishment.

##### James T Lloyd [Lloyd's telegraph, railroad & express map of the whole United States & Canadas, from official information ](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp514) (1863)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fp52d/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This is a geographically accurate depiction of the Great Lakes area intended to advertise Lloyd’s (the cartographer) telegraph, railroad, and express mapping company. The ad shows off the company's vast presence throughout this region, with more than 200 railroads and ten telegraph lines. To make life even more accessible for the consumer, they also provided estimated service costs and where precisely they can be visited within this area. During the 19th century, a tool like this would have been helpful to anybody traveling through the Greater Lakes region who was unfamiliar with the territory.

##### Geo H Walker and Co [Trolley wayfinder, birds eye view of trolley routes in New England](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:jh343z12j)  (1904-05)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:jh343z13t/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="figure-left" >}}

One mode of transportation not explicitly mentioned in this collection of maps is the trolley. The New England Street Railway Club commissioned this piece to advertise their trolley services across the New England area and provide their consumers with an accurate map that mentions the trolley stops. It's typical for these maps to act as a detailed guide, with information about the services they offered. The map highlights sections of New England that the trolley passes through and provides the price, distance, and scheduled timing of every trip. This type of ad heavily appealed to their audience as most people utilizing these types of transport are leisure travelers as well.
