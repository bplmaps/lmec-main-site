> *On September 5, we hosted **From The Vault — The Best State Around: Historic, Promotional State Maps.***

**It’s not uncommon to be proud of the place you live… but these maps take it to another level!**

In this *From The Vault*, we’ll take a look at some promotional state maps from the 1890s to 1930s. Some maps use comedy to poke fun at the rest of the country, while others espouse the successes and deep history of their land to capture a potential visitor’s attention. Each state does things a little differently and we invite visitors to answer the question: *“What truly is the best state around?"*

#### Elizabeth Shurtleff and Helen F. McMillin, *[Map of the state of New Hampshire : looking over our whole country from east to west, let me ask if such a map was ever before presented to the eye - Daniel Webster](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm652)* (1926)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fm66b/full/2000,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Designed and drawn by two female artists, [this pictorial map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm652) includes humorous and historical drawings and references. In the margins, one can see color illustrations of various emblems of towns, organizations, local schools, and points of community interest. Some of these places are even illustrated on the map itself, telling us in more than words that although this map may seem serious from afar, hints of a simpler, sillier life can be found as well. Note the hordes of visitors (future residents?) driving in from different locations all around the state’s borders in a rush to reach the Granite State!

#### Ernest Dudley Chase, [The United States as viewed by California (very unofficial)](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:st74cw264) (1940)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:st74cw27d/full/2000,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Recognized for his whimsical pictorial maps, Chase created [this highly distorted view of the United States as perceived by Californians](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:st74cw264). One-third the size of the rest of the country, the state is perpetually drenched by the sun. A bustling California is also depicted as a cornucopia of plenty, teaming with industry, agriculture, recreational activity, and natural wonders. The rest of the county is overshadowed by a dark cloud and a vast, depressing spider web. Other states are distorted or are omitted entirely. However, Chase’s native New England retains its shape and receives some sunlight for half of the year.

#### James Frank Oliver, [A Texan's map of the United States \[of Texas\]](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c370) (1949)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fn107c388/full/2000,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This cartoon pictorial map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c370) shows Texas as occupying about half of the area of the United States, with comic place names like “EL Paso: Where the sun spends the winter”. As a “Texan's map of the United States \[of Texas],” this map is full of Lone Star-centrism, from the Atlantic Ocean—now known as the “East Gulf of Texas”—to a sign planted on the California coast marking the “City Limits of Dallas.” Even the scale admits to its distortion, noting that 1 “Texas Inch” is equal to 1,000 miles. Within the state itself, a large orange heart spotlights the town of Crockett, a town which had fewer than 6,000 people at the time this map was made, but marked the home of the map's publisher, the Texoak company.

#### François Levernay, *[Plan de l'isthme de Suez, de Port-Said, Ismailia et Suez pour servir d'annexe au guide général d'Egypte](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht250c09t)* (1868)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:ht250c10k/full/2225,/0/default.jpg" >}}

The Suez Canal was one of the most ambitious projects of the 19th century, a connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Egypt was then ruled by the Khedive Isma’il Pasha, who sold the rights for construction to a French company. The three cities depicted on the top of the map were all company towns, built specifically to house tens of thousands of laborers, many of whom were forced to work by French authorities. The conditions were very poor, with thousands of workers dying from diseases like cholera. A year after [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht250c09t) was published, the port of Ismailia held a lavish opening ceremony for the canal, attended by the rulers and ambassadors of many European countries.

#### *[Map of Jerusalem : reduced from the Ordnance Survey ; Smyrna ; the Maltese Islands](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:mg74wm43v)* \[ca. 1880–1889]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:2b88wd735/full/2225,/0/default.jpg" >}}

European Christians, Muslims, and Jews have all lived in Jerusalem for centuries due to the city’s sacred status in all three faiths. [This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:mg74wm43v) was made by a British agency in the late 19th century. The British Empire, like many other European nations, was interested in exercising influence over the holy city, particularly to secure rights for Christians. The city plan labels the areas of various religious communities, which were generally concentrated around their respective shrines. An Orthodox Christian compound outside city walls, labelled here “Russian Property,” was built under pressure from the Russian Empire.

#### Muneyasu Kageyama, *[Tsukiji hatchōbori nihonbashi minami no kuni](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:5138qd959)* (1859)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3b596d33m/full/2225,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Unlike every other map in this collection, [this plan of a Tokyo neighborhood](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:5138qd959) was not made by, or for, Europeans. In the mid-19th century, Japan placed severe restrictions on foreign visitors, only opening to Western merchants by 1856. Tokyo, then called Edo, was home to much of Japan’s feudal nobility, such as the hatamoto clans and daimyo lords. Their residences are labelled here with clan names and insignias. Maps like this one were typically not very scale-accurate, and were intended to guide travelers through the maze-like streets of one of the world’s largest cities. Like modern travel guide maps, this map could be folded and carried in one’s pocket for ease of use.

#### *[A map of Cyprus reduced from the coast survey by Captn. Graves; Alexandria (Egypt); map of Jerusalem reduced from the Ordnance Survey](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7940g302v)* \[ca. 1877]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:8g84tp93w/full/2225,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This British-made map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7940g302v) depicts the Egyptian port of Alexandria. Due to its ancient and longstanding history, Alexandria was particularly fascinating to Europeans. This fascination only grew when a little-known young general, Napoleon Bonaparte, conquered Alexandria from its Ottoman rulers. On this map, Napoleon’s old fort is labeled in the city center. Although Alexandria ultimately returned to Ottoman control, it was heavily influenced by European powers, and fell into British hands in 1882. The streets, hotels, military installations, and geographic features present a mix of English, French, and Arabic names that speak to the ethnic divisions within Alexandria.

#### Prussia (Germany). Landesaufnahme. Kartogr. Abteilung, *[Peking](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161h74w)* (1903)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161h755/full/2225,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Beijing, also known as “Peking” in 1903, was the capital of China during the Qing Dynasty. European powers forced the Qing emperors to operate within the highly destructive opium trade and required China to open its cities to European merchants and missionaries. In Beijing, foreigners were restricted to a special area known as the “Legation Quarter,” located just below the Imperial Palace in the middle of the map. Much of the city was ethnically segregated, both inside and outside the Legation Quarter, with German cartographers labelling large areas of the city as “Manchu,” “Chinese,” or “Tatar.” Three years before [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161h74w) was made, the Legation Quarter was put to siege by the “Boxers,” Chinese rebels against European authority. The walled military-like layout of the quarter made it possible for the Europeans to hold out against the Boxers.

#### Abraham Ortelius, *[La Florida](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:2514p098w)* \[1574?]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:2514p0995/648,305,6712,5177/2225,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map was made in the 16th century by Abraham Ortelius, a Dutch cartographer working within the Spanish Empire. Drafted less than a century after Christopher Columbus’ voyage, “La Florida” is a map of regions in the Americas under Spanish influence. This included not only Florida, but also the former Inca Empire and parts of Mexico. Rivers dominate the landscape on this map, as they were crucial information for travel and commerce. Many European maps made in this time portrayed the Americas as “wild” and “untamed,” with the first recognized cities being built by new settlers. [Ortelius’ map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:2514p098w), however, shows the rivers to be surrounded by towns, the majority of which were indigenous in origin.
