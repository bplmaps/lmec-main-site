Many in the United States observe the month of February as Black History Month to celebrate the “[too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans...throughout history](https://blackhistorymonth.gov/about/)” and coordinate the “[teaching of Black history in public schools](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/01/1075623826/why-is-february-black-history-month).” To recognize Black History Month—and acknowledge that teachings of Black history should not be limited to just the 28 days of February—we’ve rounded up some materials that reflect on historical figures, geographies, and cartographies that worked to either enable and inhibit the empowerment of Black communities.

#### Geographies of exclusion

In the autobiographical writings of "To Be Young, Gifted and Black," Lorraine Hansberry recollects her childhood experiences growing up in Chicago’s Washington Park, specifically the violence endured by her family at the hands of their white neighbors. Hansberry’s father purchased their Washington Park home through a white intermediary and soon became the subject of a lawsuit by a resident intent on preserving the racial integrity of his neighborhood.

This seemingly-cheerful pictorial map of Chicago from 1931 includes racist imagery of Black and Asian residents as it boasts of the city's youthful vigor and industriousness. These visual representations accompany the racial divisions orchestrated by the banking and real estate industries as Black Americans poured into Chicago from the South during the Great Migration and reflect the ideas that provoked the violence faced by those families, like Hansberry's, that risked crossing the lines.

#### Race and space

The previously discussed logics fueling racial and spatial segregation are deeply rooted in U.S. property and loan practices. Last month, LMEC Assistant Curator [Ian Spangler](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/ian-spangler/) sat down with PhD candidate [Scott Markley](https://snmarkley1.github.io/) to discuss these histories and legacies within [Homeowners Loan Corporation (HOLC) “redlining” maps](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/scott-markley-interview/), commonly referenced today to demonstrate the histories and geographies of racial discrimination in U.S. cities.

HOLC maps were created to evaluate investment risk for mortgage assistance and loans in urban areas based on factors like Black population percentage, “foreign-born” population percentage and group, family income, occupation class, average building age, home repair status, and mortgage availability. The resulting maps often produced implicit claims on the relationship between value and race in cities: if Black folks were moving into a white neighborhood, it would be considered by neighborhood appraisers as “in decline” because Black residential presence was thought to speed up the neighborhood aging process, so to speak.

#### Mapping racial inequality, violence, and progress

While limited by efforts of geographic exclusion, many Black activists drew on their own geographic analyses and visualizations as a mode to communicate racial injustices.

One such study came from Ida B. Wells, a Black journalist and activist born into slavery in 1862 Holly Springs, Mississippi. In the late-nineteenth century, Wells began tracking lynching statistics from newspaper records by alleged offense, date, name of individual (if known), and relative location. In 1895, she published the resulting report, a 100-page pamphlet, [_A Red Record_](https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=LCCN&searchArg=2020446877&searchType=1&permalink=y)_,_ drawing on “[geographically rectified data](https://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2022/01/visualizing-injustice-early-naacp-cartographers-and-racial-inequality-in-america/)” to detail over 10,000 cases of lynching in the United States from 1864 to 1894. This comprehensive study presented a [geographic distribution](https://www.nypl.org/events/exhibitions/galleries/beginnings/item/3548) of lynchings and thus introduced the possibility of visually translating such data in map form.

On February 12, 1909, Ida B. Wells joined an interracial group of activists––including W.E.B Du Bois, Mary Church Terrell, Archibald Grimke, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, William English Walling, and Dr. Henry Moscowitz––to form the National Association of Colored People (NAACP). The group’s formation came as a response to race riots and disturbing trends of lynching during and following the Civil War and Reconstruction era.

In 1919, the NAACP published one of their most influential works, [Thirty Years of Lynching in the United States](https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=12706&recCount=25&recPointer=0&bibId=8720588), to present a comprehensive study of lynching in response to anti-Black violence, racial inequalities, and regional differences during the period of time from 1889 to 1918. Similar to Wells’ _Red Record_, the NAACP’s publication tracks geographic distribution of lynching from 1909 to 1918, but presents the data visually on [this map](https://www.loc.gov/static/classroom-materials/naacp-a-century-in-the-fight-for-freedom/documents/lynching.pdf) using a discernible scale of hatching, striping, and shading.

Earlier in the twentieth-century, NAACP member W.E.B Du Bois published a series of maps for an exhibit at the 1900 [Exposition Universell](https://blogs.loc.gov/maps/2022/01/visualizing-injustice-early-naacp-cartographers-and-racial-inequality-in-america/)e in Paris. Highlighting Black ownership of land, migration, and population distribution, Du Bois hoped his maps would inform the international community about the gains Black communities had made in “[income, education, and land ownership since slavery and in face of continuing racism](https://theconversation.com/how-black-cartographers-put-racism-on-the-map-of-america-155081).”
