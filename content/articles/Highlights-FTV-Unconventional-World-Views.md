> *On September 5, we hosted **From The Vault — Unconventional World Views.***

So… what if we told you the world map you’re used to seeing isn’t actually “the most accurate” depiction of the world we inhabit?

The Mercator projection, introduced in 1569 by Gerardus Mercator, has long been considered a “default” world map, especially amongst audiences in the Western Hemisphere. Every type of projection distorts the original geometry of the curved, three-dimensional earth in some way, but because we’re so used to seeing projected maps of the globe, those distortions no longer look strange to us. Could different map perspectives help us refresh our view to see things a little differently?

Take a closer look at maps from the Leventhal Center’s collection as we answer these questions!

#### Ernest Dudley Chase, [Mercator map of the world united : a pictorial history of transport and communications and paths to permanent peace](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n371p) (1944)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:q524n372z/full/2000,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This world map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:q524n371p) is done using the Mercator Projection. For many, this is a familiar view of the globe, as this type of world projection has been popularly used by Western powers for nearly 500 years. Made popular through its usefulness to sailors and merchants, the Mercator Projection allowed them to plot their journey in a straight line without having to adjust their compasses. During the age of colonialism, this was an incredible asset, as ocean-based trade routes were crucial to global commerce.

However, while the Mercator map preserves the shapes of the landmasses, the continents' actual size can be heavily distorted. For instance, on this map Africa and North America appear to be of similar size, when in reality Africa is approximately 20% larger. This map has a specific focus on “paths to permanent peace” and emphasizes the importance of communication and accessible travel across the world. 

#### Franciscus Verhaer, [Geographica restituta per globi trientes](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462s523) (1618)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:tx31qn469/209,175,10334,6982/2000,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Displaying the known world of the early 17th century as a triptych, with the map divided into three segments or gores, was very uncommon during the Golden Age of Dutch cartography. However, such a format was commonly used in altarpieces and would have been familiar to a Christian audience. Dividing the world into three parts was also reminiscent of the world diagrams drawn in the Medieval Christian tradition, especially Heinrich Bünting's cloverleaf map also on display. 

While this three-part projection reduced the amount of distortion for the respective geographic areas, it was also a logical presentation of classical and medieval geographical tradition in the context of the new geographical knowledge gleaned from Europeans' 15th- and 16th-century explorations. The map's author was a theologian and classical historian and his other works included several small globes and maps of a historical-religious nature. In addition, the inset views portray biblical themes, including the flood and Noah's ark on the lower right. Some scholars have suggested that this relatively rare map may have been prepared as an illustration for a Bible or similar tome.

#### James Frank Oliver, *[A Texan's map of the United States \[of Texas\]](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c370)* (1949)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fn107c388/full/2000,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This cartoon pictorial map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c370) shows Texas as occupying about half of the area of the United States, with comic place names like “EL Paso: Where the sun spends the winter”. As a “Texan's map of the United States \[of Texas],” this map is full of Lone Star-centrism, from the Atlantic Ocean—now known as the “East Gulf of Texas”—to a sign planted on the California coast marking the “City Limits of Dallas.” Even the scale admits to its distortion, noting that 1 “Texas Inch” is equal to 1,000 miles. Within the state itself, a large orange heart spotlights the town of Crockett, a town which had fewer than 6,000 people at the time this map was made, but marked the home of the map's publisher, the Texoak company.

#### Daniel K. Wallingford, *[This map presents a Bostonian's idea of the United States of America](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463864z)* (1935)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f4638657/full/2000,/0/default.jpg" >}}

This may be one of our most infamous maps in the gallery! A favorite amongst locals, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463864z) highlights many of the most beloved areas and qualities of Boston and greater New England. Most noteworthy is perhaps the scale at which Boston and the cape of Massachusetts are shown, highlighting the economic and cultural importance of these areas (at least, from the perspective of a Bostonian).

#### Daniel K. Wallingford, *[A New Yorker's idea of the United States of America](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463866h)* (1936)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463867s/full/2000,/0/default.jpg" >}}

One of two Wallingford maps on display, this map takes a look at the USA “as a composite of the New Yorker’s ideas” concerning the rest of the country. Similar to the Bostonian’s View, the geographic size of New York City and the rest of the state has been blown out of proportion to a humorous degree. 

One striking difference between the two Wallingford maps is that this one often emphasizes that New Yorkers have no sense of geographic knowledge. In [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463866h), the Bronx is nearly next to Boston, Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota are listed as cities in other states, and Hollywood, California, and San Francisco are made into three entirely separate states! In a way, this lack of knowledge on other parts of the country solidifies the notion that New York City has everything anyone could ever want, leaving no reason to venture forth quite literally anywhere else in the country.

#### Grace Raymond Hebard and Paul M. Paine, *[Map of the history and romance of Wyoming](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm385)* (1928)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fm39f/full/2000,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Perhaps more humble than some of the other maps on display, this pictorial map of Wyoming asserts itself to be just as prideful of the land it calls home. Poetry, folk tales, art, and state history can be found across every corner of the map. Other writing on the map appeals directly to visitors, calling Wyoming the “Last American Frontier" with “Broad, open spaces” and “The land of plenty”. Using [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm385), we can see that though less boastful than some others, this map was still very intentionally trying to piece together a favorable view of this rolling, open land.

#### Bob Fletcher and Irvin Shope, *[Frontier, Montana, pioneer : a one page history dedicated to the Old](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm520)* (1937)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fm538/full/2000,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Harkening back to the “Manifest Destiny” rhetoric of early settlers, this map was published by the newly formed Montana Highway Dept. as a way to entice other Americans to move to the state. “A one page history dedicated to the Old Timers”, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm520) includes text, illustrations of select sites, and a descriptive historical legend. In addition to the highly detailed map, the reverse side is full of evocative images of White, American pioneers and a “Tabloid History” of the early history of the state. Though heavily present throughout the history of the state, the Indigenous Peoples of the region are rarely mentioned in a positive tone, making it quite clear they were not the intended audience for this map.

#### Cody's Ltd, *[Map of Canada : (as seen by a maritimer)](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8967740)* \[1955–1975?]

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Canada Mariner's Map.jpg" >}}

Though not a part of the United States, we had to spotlight [this unique map of Canada](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8967740), completed in a similar style to many of the more playful maps on display. This distorted map of Canada depicts the Atlantic Provinces normally while minimizing the rest of Canada. Taking a slightly sillier approach, places have been described by superlatives or historical notes instead of proper names.
