The Leventhal Center has an extraordinary collection of [urban atlases](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\&f%5Bcollection_name_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Urban+Maps+%28Collection+of+Distinction%29\&f%5Bsubject_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Boston+%28Mass.%29--Maps\&search_field=dummy_range\&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=1860\&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bend%5D=1950\&commit=Apply) dating from the late 19th to early 20th centuries, one of the most important sets of documents for depicting how our city and region have changed over time. Our [Atlascope tool](https://www.atlascope.org/) has transformed 110 of these atlases into a web interface overlaying the modern map, covering historic Boston and its immediate surrounding towns.

Earlier this year, we released an upgraded version of Atlascope with new features to empower storytelling, annotation, and discovery, as well as connections into other Massachusetts digital collections. One of these new features is a tour feature, which allows individual Atlascope users to narrate their own historical story on a theme or topic important to them. Just like a physical walking tour, these annotated tours lead the tour-taker through specific sites in and around Boston, highlighting important buildings, streets, or relevant facts, and illuminating historical tidbits among the atlas layers.

Whether it’s a tour of the best parks in your neighborhood, tracing underground subway routes, or chronicling the changing landscape of Boston’s music and theater scenes in the twentieth century,  **Atlascope Tours** allow you—as either the creator or the tour-taker—to take a stroll through Boston history, exploring the city from the comfort of your couch and screen.

> The two latest Atlascope tours were researched, written, and created by Boston Latin School students [Zoe Colimon](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/zoe-colimon/) and [Salman Uddin](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/salman-uddin/) over the course of their Summer 2023 Seevak Fellowship with the Leventhal Center.
