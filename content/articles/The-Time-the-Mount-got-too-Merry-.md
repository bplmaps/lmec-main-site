[Merrymount](https://www.worldhistory.org/Merrymount_Colony/) Colony was first established in New England as a settlement by the name of Mount Wollaston in 1624 CE. Governed as a trade post rather than a residential colony, like the [Plymouth Colony](https://www.worldhistory.org/New_England_Colonies/) to the south, it was originally managed by Captain Richard Wollaston for the purpose of trading guns and liquor with the Indigenous Massachusett for furs and food stuffs.

Members of Wollaston's crew included Thomas Morton, an English lawyer and writer, and around 30 indentured servants. In 1626 CE,  just two years after the colony was established, Wollaston traveled to Jamestown, Virginia and sold some of his indentured servants into slavery. Morton, who was in Mount Wollaston at the time, was enraged by this news, and encouraged the remaining servants to rebel against Wollaston's remaining second-in-command and help  establish an egalitarian society. Wollaston never returned to Massachusetts and died later that same year—leaving Morton’s claim to power uncontested.

Morton renamed the colony to Ma-re Mount, also known today as "Merrymount". The name was a play on the word “merrie”, or the emotion of "merry", which was soon deeply criticized by nearby Puritans and Pilgrims for emphasizing the very actions and attitudes they found offensive. However, the name was also a play on the French word mer for “sea”, as the colony was right by the water.

Morton disagreed heavily with Puritan rules and ways of doing things, including the enforcement of religion as a way of life. Morton tolerated any religious beliefs contrary to the Puritans, including Indigenous spiritual beliefs, English pagan beliefs, and Anglicanism. In addition, he disliked the system of hierarchy and leadership that Puritans enforced, so instead of assuming a governor position, Morton declared himself a “host” and considered all in the community as equals—as he had promised at the colony's conception. This included the Indigenous groups in the area, who Morton respected more than the Christian colonists that he interacted with in the region. He even sold guns to the Indigenous Massachusett people, which especially alarmed the Puritans in Plymouth Colony, and later the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Morton's position as "host" included "hosting" in the manner of a party, as Morton enjoyed leisurely pastimes. So much so, that in 1627 CE, he erected an 80-foot tall [Maypole](https://discoverquincy.com/museums___attraction/maypole-hill/) in town square and provided everyone with strong alcohol for a multiday long celebration for May Day. [May Day](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/discover/history/the-history-of-may-day), as it was celebrated by the English in Morton's time, was a single day of festivals, feasting, and dancing to celebrate spring. However, it held Pagan origins and to the Puritans, dancing around the Maypole was akin to idolatry.

In 1628 CE, a maypole was erected for the second time and Plymouth Colony Governor William Bradford ordered his arrest. Morton had already angered the nearby colonists with his trading of guns to Indigenous people and the maypole of the previous year, however the decision for this arrest order was also driven by anxiety.

Merrymount was quickly growing to be prosperous because of its involvement in agriculture and the fur trade, while Plymouth was struggling economically. In addition, religious anxiety was a motivator as Puritans saw their colonial project as a divine plan, which made dealing with Merrymount a “test” for their success.

Thomas Morton was arrested in 1628 CE for his “heathen” behavior (as well as attempting to legally defend it) and was forcibly exiled to the Isle of Shoals off the coast—surviving through the help of what may have been the neraby Piscataquak peoples. He returned to Merrymount in 1629 CE. In response, the Puritan John Endicott (future governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony) chopped down Merrymount's Maypole and burned down Morton’s house, alongwith the entire settlement.

Morton was deported back to England one final time, cementing the end of the Merrymount colony. He sued to have the Massachusetts Bay Colony’s charter revoked, and later wrote his famed three-volume series on New England, New English Canaan, which was published in 1637 CE. Despite Massachusetts’ Puritan legacy, not everyone conformed to the religious norms and rules in place. While Morton's ideas and actions may be seen as more progressive than his puritan neighbors, with the [extent](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-americas-first-banned-book-survived-and-became-an-anti-authoritarian-icon-180982971/) of Merrymount's "openness" oft-debated, he was not without his faults.

Morton described local Indigenous people in a positive light, but he referred to them with dehumanizing language such as "[savages](https://umsystem.pressbooks.pub/alpt1865/chapter/author-introduction-thomas-morton/)" and wanted to convert them to Anglicanism. In the same breath, he also was more than willing to live alongside the Algonquian people and learn about their culture while Puritans were against co-existence. Overall, however, his intent on Passanageset (the original Massachusett tribal name for Merrymount) was colonization.

In spite of his initial intent, it was Morton's opposition to his Puritan neighbors, to the extent of writing New English Canaan, that provided an alternative perspective to societal norms at a time when such opinions had disastrous consequences if expressed like exile from one’s community, and thus chance of survival. Morton and the Merrymount colony were vilified for centuries after his death. However, beginning in the 19th-century, some writers were sympathetic to his ideology, with Nathaniel Hawthorne writing “The May-Pole of Merry Mount” based on the sorrowful destruction of Merrymount in 1837 CE. Opinions on Morton have completely changed, though, in the last fifty years.

While Thomas Morton was not the perfect protagonist, inadvertently and but for a brief period, he carved out a space of joy for colonists and Indigenous Massachusett people alike, where cultural and spiritual practices could be shared to replace the anxiety of existing in an unforgiving terrain.
