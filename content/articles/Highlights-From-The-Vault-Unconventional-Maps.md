> *On December 6, we hosted **From The Vault: Unconventional Maps***.

When reading maps, we expect map makers to use standard conventions, especially in regard to map projection or composition, orientation, scale, and symbols. But what about those times when a map maker does things a bit differently than expected? What is the story the map maker is trying to tell?

In this From the Vault collections showing, each map highlights a variety of unconventional cartographic styles spanning the history of the printed map.

#### New Internationalist Publications, [The World Turned Upside Down](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161j433) (2005)

Oriented with South at the top, [this “upside-down” world map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161j433) presents a disconcerting image, but clearly conveys a message that unconventional world views can be meaningful. Prepared for an organization that reports on global poverty and inequality, the map helps to teach “people to see the world from a broader, more inclusive perspective.”

Traditional, north-oriented world maps emphasize Europe and North America, implying that other continents are less important. This contrary perspective places Africa and South America in the center, emphasizing that the southern hemisphere’s countries are equally important.

#### Louise E. Jefferson, ***[Uprooted people of the U.S.A.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:t722kt12g)*** (1945)

With a map like this, we ask students: **How does the cartographer capture our attention?**

At first glance, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:t722kt12g) may look like a typical twentieth-century tourist map of the United States. The color palette of primary colors, inclusion of numerous figures across the map and the decorative border all echo the maps sold to travelers to promote positive views of the United States.

This map was created by Louise E. Jefferson, an African American woman who achieved success in many fields. In this map, Jefferson highlights the impact of war on where and how Americans live. She points in her caption in the lower left corner that 25,000,000 Americans have been physically uprooted since 1940. Across the country she includes factors included Japanese internment camps, multiple negro migrations, and military training facilities. Jefferson demonstrates the complicated landscape of war from victory gardens to prisoner of war camps.

#### Don Bloodgood, ***[Ask Shell!](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6969z354f)*** \[1948–1955]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fn107c46z/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6969z354f) rewards the viewer with a feast of activity. With so much going on, we start by asking students: **What do you notice first?**

As we absorb the scene, we see all sorts of high jinks as campers wrestle with tents, fishermen are caught by their own hooks, cows eat paintings, and row boats tip over their passengers. Broken down cars are scattered across the roads.

We realize this map isn't really a map at all, at least not one of a real place. Instead, it's an imaginary mashup of the American West, the iconic landscape for the family road trips which became a rite of passage for many Americans in the postwar years, when this was published. A mutually reinforcing relationship between map publishers, oil and gas companies, automobile manufacturers, and tourist boards during this period made the road map one of the most recognizable forms of popular cartography.

#### Republican National Committee, ***[Electoral votes for President in 1916 and for Congress in 1918 : make your guess for 1920](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fq53w)*** \[1919?]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fq545/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

We have become accustomed to making assumptions about “red” and “blue” states. However, the colors have not always had the same assumptions of political allegiance.

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fq53w) uses blue and red for elections in a different way than we are used to in 2024.

We ask students, **“What patterns and trends do you see?”**

#### John Russell, James Cutler, and Simon Gardner, ***[Natural and political history of the Gerry-mander! : In two chapters](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3t947b80f)*** \[1813–1822]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3t947b81q/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" >}}

When Governor Elbridge Gerry took the map of Massachusetts in 1812 and redrew a State Senate district around Salem so that it would contain more voters loyal to his Democratic-Republican Party, outraged opponents published a cartoon of the district's outline forming the figure of a salamander. The new term, *gerry-mander*, stuck, and has been used ever since to describe the practice of drawing electoral maps for unfair partisan advantage.

We would engage in a long conversation with students about **“How do we determine who fits? What does ‘fair’ look like on [the map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3t947b80f)?”**
