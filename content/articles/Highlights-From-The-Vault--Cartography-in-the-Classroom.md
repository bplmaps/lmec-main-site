#### George H. Bartlett, [The public schools of Massachusetts](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kx577) (1893)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82kx58h/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Massachusetts has historically been a leader in providing free education for children since the late 18th century. After the American Revolutionary War, public education at the elementary level was open to both male and female children, and geography was consistently part of the curriculum. George Bartlett, an artist and school principal, produced [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kx577) illustrating the number of public schools by town throughout the state in 1892. At this time, there were over 7,000 public schools throughout the commonwealth, with women accounting for over 90% of teachers.

#### Diamond Litho-Pub'g Co., [Land measures illustrated ; percentage illustrated ; phonic analysis](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp53p) (1901)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fp54z/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This educational poster](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp53p) illustrates the structure of General Land Office township surveys. The top scene depicts surveyors laying out a single section, measuring one mile by one mile and containing 640 acres. The diagram labeled "Township Plat" demonstrates the division of a township into 36 sections, while the "Township Survey" diagram explains that townships are identified in relation to a baseline and meridian (representing an X-Y axis). Each parcel of land has a unique numerical identifier such as the 40-acre tract where the surveyors stand could be identified as the SE 1/4 of the SE 1/4 of Section 1, Township 3 North, Range 4 West, 6th Principal Meridian.

#### William Price and John Bonner, *[A new plan of ye great town of Boston in New England in America, with the many additionall buildings & new streets to the year 1743](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161952m)* (1743)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f462v50z/160,144,9124,6669/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This 1743 Price map is the seventh version, or state, of Bonner’s 1722 map. William Price, a businessman and shopkeeper from pre-Revolutionary Boston, released seven of the nine "states"—or editions—of Bonner’s map. Originally, Price’s name was featured on the second and third states alongside Bonner’s name as part of a successful re-release of Bonner’s successful original. By the fifth state, Price omitted Bonner’s name, which is not seen on this map.

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161952m) is noticeably “busier” than both Bonner’s original map and earlier states of Price maps, with the note on Faneuil Hall marketplace extending into one of the original ships sketched in Bonner's original. Another curious detail is Price’s neglect in updating Boston’s age from “103” years, showing just how quickly new states must have been issued. This new state does accurately reflect the changing political landscape of the city, featuring twelve political wards, instead of the eight wards featured in the Burgis map.

#### William Price and John Bonner, *[A new plan of ye great town of Boston in New England in America, with the many additionall \[sic\] buildings, & new streets, to the year, 1769](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462v496)* (1769)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f462v50z/160,144,9124,6669/1400,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This reproduction of the 1769 Price map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462v496) is the ninth and final state of the Bonner Map. The original is on display in our gallery under the “City” scale of our new exhibition, *[Terrains of Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/)*. One notable change is the correction of Boston’s age from 103 years to 139 years. The map also contains new annotations, including a line about when Boston was settled and the days of operation for Faneuil Hall marketplace. This map, as Price’s final map state before his death, served as the base map and starting point for many subsequent Boston mapmakers until Osgood Carleton’s official town survey, which was published in 1796 and 1797.

#### John Bonner, *[\[Boston wharves, from Long Wharf\]](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161965p)* \[1853]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161966z/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This 1853 copy](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161965p) of Captain John Bonner’s 1714 "Boston wharves from Long Wharf" demonstrates Bonner’s level of understanding of shoreline surveying that led to the creation of his famous 1722 map, “The town of Boston in New England.” Bonner labels each wharf by the name of its owner, much like in the 1722 map. The brown shading on the manuscript copy to point out the location of mudflats, is adapted into dotted aquatic areas on the 1722 Bonner map.

#### Georges-Louis Le Rouge, *[Plan de Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462v21h)* \[1755]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f462v22s/1088,708,6428,4398/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This is a 1755 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462v21h) by Georges-Louis Le Rouge was part of his volume Recueil Des Plans de l'Amérique Septentrionale and was based on the seventh state of Captain John Bonner’s 1722 map. At the time this map was issued, the French and Indian War had begun a year earlier. With a limited number of up-to-date maps of Boston available in Europe, using the Bonner map as a starting point for this map helped to satisfy increased French interest in maps of North America, especially of their English enemy's territory.

#### John Bonner, Francis Dewing, George Girdler Smith, William Price, and &#xA;Stephen P. Fuller, *[The town of Boston in New England](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4631769)* (1835)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463c21s/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This 1835 reissue of Bonner’s 1722 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4631769) is near identical in detail to other reissues and reproductions of the 1722 map. The only difference between this version and others is the signature by Stephen P. Fuller, the father of J. Franklin Fuller, on the upper-middle left side. J. Franklin Fuller was one half of the nineteenth and twentieth century surveying firm[ Fuller & Whitney,](https://archives.bpl.org/agents/corporate_entities/153) alongside William Henry Whitney. In the mid-nineteenth century, Fuller & Whitney would be credited with the filling-in and development of parts of Boston’s Back Bay and Fenway neighborhoods, filling in land on the mud flats north and west of what was Orange Street on Bonner's original map (now known as today's Washington Street).

#### Edwin Olsen, Blake Clark, and Houghton Mifflin Company, *[The colour of an old city : a map of Boston, decorative and historical](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rj432v46t)* (1926)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9306wn31r/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This [colorful 1926 Olson & Clark pictorial map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rj432v46t) has many details competing for a viewer's eye, but peering at the top left corner reveals a small Bonner map overlayed on a hatched outline of Boston’s shoreline in 1926. The bottom left map offers a close up of the 1722 Bonner map, with other famous maps of Boston appearing on the neatline (the border of the map). Since 1722, much land has been filled around Boston's original Shawmut peninsula, creating today’s neighborhoods of Back Bay, Bay Village, Fenway, the West End.
