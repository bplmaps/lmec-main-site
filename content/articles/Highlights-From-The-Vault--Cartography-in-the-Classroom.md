#### George H. Bartlett, ***[The public schools of Massachusetts](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kx577)*** (1893)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82kx58h/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Massachusetts has historically been a leader in providing free education for children since the late 18th century. After the American Revolutionary War, public education at the elementary level was open to both male and female children, and geography was consistently part of the curriculum. George Bartlett, an artist and school principal, produced [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kx577) illustrating the number of public schools by town throughout the state in 1892. At this time, there were over 7,000 public schools throughout the commonwealth, with women accounting for over 90% of teachers.

#### Diamond Litho-Pub'g Co., ***[Land measures illustrated ; percentage illustrated ; phonic analysis](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp53p)*** (1901)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fp54z/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This educational poster](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp53p) illustrates the structure of General Land Office township surveys. The top scene depicts surveyors laying out a single section, measuring one mile by one mile and containing 640 acres. The diagram labeled "Township Plat" demonstrates the division of a township into 36 sections, while the "Township Survey" diagram explains that townships are identified in relation to a baseline and meridian (representing an X-Y axis). Each parcel of land has a unique numerical identifier such as the 40-acre tract where the surveyors stand could be identified as the SE 1/4 of the SE 1/4 of Section 1, Township 3 North, Range 4 West, 6th Principal Meridian.

#### Isaac W. Moore, ***[The eagle map of the United States](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149z386)*** (1833)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149z39g/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

In [this unusual map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149z386), one pictorial image -- an eagle -- was superimposed on a map of the United States. The author of the accompanying geography book stated that the map was designed to serve as a memory device for young students learning the country's geography and history. He explained that the eagle was selected for its visual and iconic appeal. The author also made the point that secession could disfigure this national icon, suggesting that the map was intended to promote unity at a time when political debates about tariffs, slavery, and states' rights were part of the national discourse.

#### David W. McCord, *[History 2](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4637669)* (1914)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463767k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Progressive 19th century educators such as Emma Willard and William Channing Woodbridge emphasized the importance of teaching history and geography simultaneously. This practice, which continued into the early 20th century, is evident in the notebook of Lincoln High School student David McCord, displayed here. David’s book from his history class in 1914 contains notes with corresponding maps, such as those related to the Roman Empire. Historical maps allowed students to visualize places in the past, as [David’s map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4637669) of the Holy Roman Empire does.

#### Joseph Schedler, *[J. Schedler's relief map of Boston and environs](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161h55p)* (1874)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1v53jx78x/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Three-dimensional relief maps are visual aids that assist schoolchildren in understanding physical terrain. The first relief maps were created in China, and appeared in Europe in the late 18th century. [This map of Boston and vicinity](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161h55p) demonstrates the hilly character of the suburbs and harbor islands.

#### Ellen Fitz, *[Fitz globe](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f8883)* (1879)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633f889c/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Designed for educators to use in the classroom, [this twelve-inch globe](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f8883) was published in Boston by the textbook firm of Ginn and Heath. The mounting system of vertical rings was patented by Ellen Fitz, a governess from New Brunswick. She was the first woman involved in the design and manufacturing of globes.

The globe's mounting, which was Fitz's unique contribution to this educational tool, was designed to help students understand the effects of the Earth's daily rotation on its axis and yearly revolution around the Sun, with regard to daylight, twilight, and nighttime. By turning the globe's base in relation to the pointer representing the Sun's vertical ray, it is possible to observe these changes through the seasons.

#### Catherine Sargent, *[East Indies from the best authorities](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161c318)* (1791)

Prior to the American Revolutionary War, females received little formal education. However, this changed in the new Republic. Dame schools, run by women in their homes, taught reading, writing and numbers to young children, and needlework to girls. Private female academies, founded in the late 18th century, greatly expanded upon the subjects previously taught to girls. The academies taught not only the basic subjects, but geography, history, and natural science as exhibited in [this hand drawn map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161c318).
