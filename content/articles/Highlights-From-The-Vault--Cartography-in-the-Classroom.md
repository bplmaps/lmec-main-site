#### George H. Bartlett, [The public schools of Massachusetts](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kx577) (1893)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82kx58h/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Massachusetts has historically been a leader in providing free education for children since the late 18th century. After the American Revolutionary War, public education at the elementary level was open to both male and female children, and geography was consistently part of the curriculum. George Bartlett, an artist and school principal, produced [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kx577) illustrating the number of public schools by town throughout the state in 1892. At this time, there were over 7,000 public schools throughout the commonwealth, with women accounting for over 90% of teachers.

#### Diamond Litho-Pub'g Co., [Land measures illustrated ; percentage illustrated ; phonic analysis](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp53p) (1901)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fp54z/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This educational poster](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp53p) illustrates the structure of General Land Office township surveys. The top scene depicts surveyors laying out a single section, measuring one mile by one mile and containing 640 acres. The diagram labeled "Township Plat" demonstrates the division of a township into 36 sections, while the "Township Survey" diagram explains that townships are identified in relation to a baseline and meridian (representing an X-Y axis). Each parcel of land has a unique numerical identifier such as the 40-acre tract where the surveyors stand could be identified as the SE 1/4 of the SE 1/4 of Section 1, Township 3 North, Range 4 West, 6th Principal Meridian.

#### Isaac W. Moore, [The eagle map of the United States](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149z386) (1833)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149z39g/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

In [this unusual map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149z386), one pictorial image -- an eagle -- was superimposed on a map of the United States. The author of the accompanying geography book stated that the map was designed to serve as a memory device for young students learning the country's geography and history. He explained that the eagle was selected for its visual and iconic appeal. The author also made the point that secession could disfigure this national icon, suggesting that the map was intended to promote unity at a time when political debates about tariffs, slavery, and states' rights were part of the national discourse.

#### David W. McCord, [History 2](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4637669) (1914)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463767k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Progressive 19th century educators such as Emma Willard and William Channing Woodbridge emphasized the importance of teaching history and geography simultaneously. This practice, which continued into the early 20th century, is evident in the notebook of Lincoln High School student David McCord, displayed here. David’s book from his history class in 1914 contains notes with corresponding maps, such as those related to the Roman Empire. Historical maps allowed students to visualize places in the past, as [David’s map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4637669) of the Holy Roman Empire does.

#### John Bonner, *[\[Boston wharves, from Long Wharf\]](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161965p)* \[1853]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161966z/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This 1853 copy](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161965p) of Captain John Bonner’s 1714 "Boston wharves from Long Wharf" demonstrates Bonner’s level of understanding of shoreline surveying that led to the creation of his famous 1722 map, “The town of Boston in New England.” Bonner labels each wharf by the name of its owner, much like in the 1722 map. The brown shading on the manuscript copy to point out the location of mudflats, is adapted into dotted aquatic areas on the 1722 Bonner map.

#### Georges-Louis Le Rouge, *[Plan de Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462v21h)* \[1755]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f462v22s/1088,708,6428,4398/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This is a 1755 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462v21h) by Georges-Louis Le Rouge was part of his volume Recueil Des Plans de l'Amérique Septentrionale and was based on the seventh state of Captain John Bonner’s 1722 map. At the time this map was issued, the French and Indian War had begun a year earlier. With a limited number of up-to-date maps of Boston available in Europe, using the Bonner map as a starting point for this map helped to satisfy increased French interest in maps of North America, especially of their English enemy's territory.

#### John Bonner, Francis Dewing, George Girdler Smith, William Price, and &#xA;Stephen P. Fuller, *[The town of Boston in New England](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4631769)* (1835)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463c21s/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This 1835 reissue of Bonner’s 1722 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4631769) is near identical in detail to other reissues and reproductions of the 1722 map. The only difference between this version and others is the signature by Stephen P. Fuller, the father of J. Franklin Fuller, on the upper-middle left side. J. Franklin Fuller was one half of the nineteenth and twentieth century surveying firm[ Fuller & Whitney,](https://archives.bpl.org/agents/corporate_entities/153) alongside William Henry Whitney. In the mid-nineteenth century, Fuller & Whitney would be credited with the filling-in and development of parts of Boston’s Back Bay and Fenway neighborhoods, filling in land on the mud flats north and west of what was Orange Street on Bonner's original map (now known as today's Washington Street).

#### Edwin Olsen, Blake Clark, and Houghton Mifflin Company, *[The colour of an old city : a map of Boston, decorative and historical](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rj432v46t)* (1926)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9306wn31r/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This [colorful 1926 Olson & Clark pictorial map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:rj432v46t) has many details competing for a viewer's eye, but peering at the top left corner reveals a small Bonner map overlayed on a hatched outline of Boston’s shoreline in 1926. The bottom left map offers a close up of the 1722 Bonner map, with other famous maps of Boston appearing on the neatline (the border of the map). Since 1722, much land has been filled around Boston's original Shawmut peninsula, creating today’s neighborhoods of Back Bay, Bay Village, Fenway, the West End.
