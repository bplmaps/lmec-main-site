### Answering questions with many parameters

Geographic information systems (GIS), or the use of computers to create, store, and analyze spatial data, is .

The map of the Wachusett Reservoir below, published by the [Executive Office of Environmental Affairs](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/executive-office-of-energy-and-environmental-affairs) in 1988, is a good example of the kind of spatial analysis that GIS made possible. Using a [buffer tool](https://www.gislounge.com/buffers-in-gis/), the map's authors answered a question that had many spatial dimensions: 1) what percentage of unprotected area 2) within 200 feet of tributaries to the Wachusett Reservoir that 3) overlaps urban land use in Sterling and West Boylston?

Think about what information you need in order to answer this question. 

This ["layer-cake" method](https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/mcharg-design-with-nature-50th-anniversary/) of visualizing and analyzing geospatial data, pioneered by Ian McHarg in 1962, made it possible for analysts to answer questions with multiple spatial conditions. 

### Map as evidence, calculation as output

We could argue that the most important aspects of this map aren't necessarily on the map, but the *data*.

In this way, the , but if you just looked at the map by itself, you'd have a hard time figuring out what you're supposed to get out of it. The calculations for Sterling and West Boylston are really what the audience needs to see. Two numbers---24% and 14%---

So much happened behind the scenes to generate two little numbers. And two little numbers 

### Why now? The paradox of new maps

Despite undergoing radical changes over the years, many conceptual aspects of mapmaking have remained the same. Cartographers still rely on {{<popup src="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/05-fig-5-4-v2.png" class="popupTooltip" target="blank">}}"cake-layering"{{</popup>}}---a method [popularized by Ian McHarg](https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/mcharg-design-with-nature-50th-anniversary/---to represent distinct geographic features. Furthermore, GIS doesn't suitably capture the wide range of practices and theories associated with creating and storing spatial data over the long history of computer cartography. Many years 

<!-- ### Why "early computer cartography?"

Like many disciplines and professions, cartography underwent radical changes during the advent of computing. In his 1959 article ["Automation and Cartography"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/212211?seq=1), Waldo Tobler suggested we view the map "as a complex data-processing system." This suggestion would prove to be very prescient, as it was only three years later that a team of land use mappers in Canada coined the term "geographic information system."

Ironically, the networks of 

### The Applied Geographics, Inc. Records

In part, this is what makes the collections so distinct:  By focusing on a particular company's impact on GIS across the New England region, these collections add depth to a [well](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C504966) [documented](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C2037006) [history](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/GIS:+A+Short+Introduction-p-9780631235330)

### The David J. Weaver Collection



Today, computer cartography is more commonly known as geographic information systems, or GIS. , or the use of computers to create, store, and analyze spatial data, comprises an important part of our work here at the Map Center. We use GIS software to [make original maps](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4t64k502g), create [data visualizations](https://birds-eye-cards.glitch.me/), and [build tools for exploring historic collections](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org).

In addition to being GIS users, we're also fascinated by how GIS has transformed the practices surrounding cartography and spatial analysis.   nd while the history of GIS has been [fairly](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/GIS:+A+Short+Introduction-p-9780631235330) [well](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C504966) [documented](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C2037006), dedicated collections of maps produced during its early days still remain rare.[^1] That's why  -->

<!-- For example, this **shadeset** was used to {{<popup src="/images/blog/gis2-crop.png" class="popupTooltip" target="blank">}}select colors on an electrostatic plotter.{{</popup>}}Electrostatic plotters were commonly used for map printing in the 1980s and '90s, until laser printing became widely affordable and accessible.

The shadeset bears a good deal of resemblance to modern cartography color pickers, like this editor in ArcGIS Pro or the popular [ColorBrewer tool](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3).  At the same time, the shadeset is a hybrid: produced computationally, but . In other words, resources like the shadeset aren't mere nostalgia for a time when printers were a little different: they help illuminate the material histories and practices associated with geography, computation, and GIS. -->

In 1962, the landscape architect Ian McHarg devised [the "layer-cake" method](https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/mcharg-design-with-nature-50th-anniversary/) of visualizing geospatial data.

"Today's GIS professionals may be excused for not knowing the many pathways that comprise the current global mosaic of GIS systems, methods, people, and projoects," writes Timothy W. Foresman in his *History of Geographic Information Systems*. "Indeed thousands of attendees at annual vendor-organized GIS user conferences may be patently ignorant of any specific vendor's place in this history."[^2]

The situation Foresman's observation rings true today, despite the fact that he wrote those sentences in 1998. -->
