> *On August 8, we hosted **From The Vault — Cartography at Length: The Longest Maps in the Library.***

If we organized maps by something like their length, would we still see patterns emerge? Could we learn something about geography and history from looking at the longest maps in a library? It turns out, the answer is “Yes.”

During *Cartography at Length* we looked into some of the longest and tallest maps in the LMEC archives, all of which are at least 3 times as wide as they are tall (or vice versa). From rivers to railroads, from green parks to gold rushes, these maps document how cartographers have fixated on long landscapes—including one 12-foot long map of the Boston Marathon, printed on a receipt!

#### John J. Pratt, *[Map of the route to the Kansas gold mines : prepared from government and other surveys : showing the most direct railroad routes from the Atlantic cities to the Missouri River](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f905j)* (1859)

*Width and length: 81 x 20cm, Aspect ratio: 3.8*

Angular black lines stitch together cities from Boston to Santa Fe in [this 1859 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f905j) of the Gold Rush. The railroad routes shown here stretch thousands of miles and would be traversed by over 300,000 gold-seeking settlers between 1848 and 1861. Maps like this one, which document where gold was and how prospectors could get there, encouraged the desire for wealth and riches just as much as the gossip and hearsay that traveled back east from California. 

The parts of central Colorado marked “Gold Region” are now home to familiar cities; “Pikes Peak” would become Colorado Springs, for instance, while the name “Denvir City” is stuffed behind a much larger label for “Mines.” Just visible at the bottom of the map, modern-day Oklahoma is listed as “Indian Territory”—a reminder of the millions of Indigenous lives and distinct societies that were obliterated or forcibly relocated during this period of genocidal western expansion and settler colonial capture.

#### Geo. H. Walker & Co., [Map of Commonwealth Avenue Street Railway Company, and connecting lines : showing route to Norumbega Park](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1g05ht759) (1898)

Width and length: 54 x 14cm, Aspect ratio: 3.8

On[ this 1898 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1g05ht759) of the Commonwealth Avenue Street Railway Company, pastels colors distinguish different towns in the Greater Boston area. A bright red railroad line leads to Norumbega Park, bursting at the western edge of Newton’s seams with carnival attractions: soda fountain, boat house, merry-go-round, and much more. In the late 19th century, private railway companies often built destination parks at the end of their line to encourage patronage and incentivize ridership. In the case of Norumbega Park, riders were also incentivized by “the long open cars”—proudly built by J.M. Jones Sons of West Troy, N.Y.—which presumably delivered a luxurious journey to this luxurious destination.

#### Henry M. Wightman, [Plan of proposed Muddy River improvement, showing contours : July 23, 1881](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht2503141) (1881)

Width and length: 94 x 22cm, Aspect ratio: 4.27

How does one “plan” a river? Originally part of the Back Bay salt marsh, the narrow, tidal Muddy River formed the boundary between Boston and Brookline. By 1880, urban growth polluted and frequently flooded the once-flowing tributary. That year, Frederick Law Olmsted proposed improvements to the Muddy River. [This plan](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht2503141)—drawn by a City of Boston engineer one year later, in 1881—depicts the contours of Olmsted’s proposal with red lines. 

Created for the Park Department, the plan represents a point-in-time snapshot of the landscape known today as the Back Bay Fens (although the provisional title of ”Back Bay Park” is visible at the eastern edge of the map). Winding from the Boston Common all the way to Jamaica Pond, this plan captures one leg of Olmsted’s famous “Emerald Necklace” park system.

#### *[Bird's eye view of Boston Harbor and south shore to Provincetown showing steamboat routes](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3760753)* (1901)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9k41zj58k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This 1901 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3760753) was on the front cover of a pamphlet called “Bird’s Eye View of Boston Harbor and the South Shore to Provincetown Showing Steamboat Routes.”

The pamphlet was sponsored by the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad, which at the time, owned and operated a passenger rail and steamboat service on the South Shore and south coast—what was then known as the “Old Colony Railroad.” The aim of the pamphlet was to encourage tourism to the areas south of Boston, and this cover provided a beautiful rendition of the South Shore. Primary steamboat lines are depicted on the map: Boston to Plymouth, Provincetown, and New York. These steamboats served to make tourism and regional vacationing more accessible to the middle class.

#### Geo. H. Walker & Co, *[Boston Harbor](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ng454q77c)* (1897)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9k422m36m/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Published in 1897 by the Walker Lithograph & Publishing Company, Boston Harbor provides a bird’s eye view of the harbor, including the major landmarks and steamboat routes characterizing Boston’s shoreline. Centered on this map are the economic strongholds of 1800s Boston: industrial South Boston, the historic waterfront along Atlantic Avenue in Downtown Boston, and the major East Boston shipping and rail hub connecting Boston to northern New England and the world. This map also highlights many Revolutionary and Civil War-era island forts scattered throughout the harbor, and offers a glimpse into the picturesque coastal village towns surrounding the heart of the harbor.

From this aerial view, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ng454q77c) illustrates the local ferry connections that carried people through the harbor during the golden age of the steamboat. In the bottom left-hand corner of the frame, the East Boston Ferries run between Lewis Mall Wharf in East Boston and “Steam Boat Landing” in the North End, which shipbuilders and dock workers might’ve used to get to and from work on the waterfront. And departing from Lewis Wharf, Central Wharf, and Rowes Wharf are the ferries that brought passengers to the region’s summertime retreats: Winthrop via the Winthrop Steamboat Company, Nahant via the “Nahant Line Steamers,” and Hull via the Nantasket Beach Steamboat Company.

#### Nantasket Beach Steamboat Company, *[Boston to Nantasket Beach and Plymouth](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fq413)* \[ca. 1915]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fq42c/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Through the early 20th century, Hull became famous for Nantasket Beach and Paragon Park, which attracted summer vacationers from all over Greater Boston. The Nantasket Beach Steamboat Company grew a successful business by bringing passengers from Boston and Hingham via ferry across Boston Harbor. The steamboat company also ran to Plymouth, offering easy access to a quiet retreat on the historic waterfront.

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fq413) was originally part of a promotional pamphlet advertising the Nantasket Beach Steamboat Company’s service to these fashionable summer destinations. Paragon Park has since closed, but Nantasket Beach continues to be a popular summertime beach destination. 

The MBTA runs regular commuter ferry service to Hull as part of the Hingham-Hull-Logan Airport-Boston route, which expands the utility of the ferry beyond vacationing. Today, there is no ferry service connecting Boston to Plymouth.

#### Boston & Gloucester Steamship Co., *[Boston & Gloucester Steamboat Co.: summer season 1889](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp956)* (1889)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fp96g/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Seaside retreats and ferries that toured the coastlines have been popular summer vacation activities since the advent of the steamboat. In the late 1800s, Gloucester was a popular long-distance ferry destination for Bostonians. [This brochure](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp956) was distributed in the summer of 1889 by the Boston & Gloucester Steamboat Company to promote its recreational ferry service to Gloucester. These trips were just as much about sight-seeing from the ferry as they were about reaching the vacation destination.

Today, taking a ferry to one of Greater Boston’s many quaint coastal towns is still one of the summer’s best activities to do on the water. The MBTA runs ferries to Hull, which is most well known for the beautiful Nantasket Beach. Boston Harbor City Cruises also runs private, long-distance ferries to Provincetown via the Cape Cod Fast Ferry out of Downtown Boston and Salem. Alternatively, you can also get to the Cape from Boston’s Seaport via Bay State Cruise Company’s Provincetown Fast Ferry.
