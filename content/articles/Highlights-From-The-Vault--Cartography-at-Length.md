> *On August 8, we hosted **From The Vault — Cartography at Length: The Longest Maps in the Library.***

If we organized maps by something like their length, would we still see patterns emerge? Could we learn something about geography and history from looking at the longest maps in a library? It turns out, the answer is “Yes.”

During *Cartography at Length* we looked into some of the longest and tallest maps in the LMEC archives, all of which are at least 3 times as wide as they are tall (or vice versa). From rivers to railroads, from green parks to gold rushes, these maps document how cartographers have fixated on long landscapes—including one 12-foot long map of the Boston Marathon, printed on a receipt!

#### John J. Pratt, *[Map of the route to the Kansas gold mines : prepared from government and other surveys : showing the most direct railroad routes from the Atlantic cities to the Missouri River](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f905j)* (1859)

*Width and length: 81 x 20cm, Aspect ratio: 3.8*

Angular black lines stitch together cities from Boston to Santa Fe in [this 1859 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f905j) of the Gold Rush. The railroad routes shown here stretch thousands of miles and would be traversed by over 300,000 gold-seeking settlers between 1848 and 1861. Maps like this one, which document where gold was and how prospectors could get there, encouraged the desire for wealth and riches just as much as the gossip and hearsay that traveled back east from California. 

The parts of central Colorado marked “Gold Region” are now home to familiar cities; “Pikes Peak” would become Colorado Springs, for instance, while the name “Denvir City” is stuffed behind a much larger label for “Mines.” Just visible at the bottom of the map, modern-day Oklahoma is listed as “Indian Territory”—a reminder of the millions of Indigenous lives and distinct societies that were obliterated or forcibly relocated during this period of genocidal western expansion and settler colonial capture.

#### Geo. H. Walker & Co., [Map of Commonwealth Avenue Street Railway Company, and connecting lines : showing route to Norumbega Park](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1g05ht759) (1898)

Width and length: 54 x 14cm, Aspect ratio: 3.8

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7d27c9574/full/3500,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}


On[ this 1898 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1g05ht759) of the Commonwealth Avenue Street Railway Company, pastels colors distinguish different towns in the Greater Boston area. A bright red railroad line leads to Norumbega Park, bursting at the western edge of Newton’s seams with carnival attractions: soda fountain, boat house, merry-go-round, and much more. In the late 19th century, private railway companies often built destination parks at the end of their line to encourage patronage and incentivize ridership. In the case of Norumbega Park, riders were also incentivized by “the long open cars”—proudly built by J.M. Jones Sons of West Troy, N.Y.—which presumably delivered a luxurious journey to this luxurious destination.

#### Henry M. Wightman, [Plan of proposed Muddy River improvement, showing contours : July 23, 1881](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht2503141) (1881)

Width and length: 94 x 22cm, Aspect ratio: 4.27

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:ht2503159/full/3500,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

How does one “plan” a river? Originally part of the Back Bay salt marsh, the narrow, tidal Muddy River formed the boundary between Boston and Brookline. By 1880, urban growth polluted and frequently flooded the once-flowing tributary. That year, Frederick Law Olmsted proposed improvements to the Muddy River. [This plan](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht2503141)—drawn by a City of Boston engineer one year later, in 1881—depicts the contours of Olmsted’s proposal with red lines. 

Created for the Park Department, the plan represents a point-in-time snapshot of the landscape known today as the Back Bay Fens (although the provisional title of ”Back Bay Park” is visible at the eastern edge of the map). Winding from the Boston Common all the way to Jamaica Pond, this plan captures one leg of Olmsted’s famous “Emerald Necklace” park system.

#### Harbour Commissioers of Montreal, [Profile of the river St. Lawrence between Montreal and Quebec shewing the deepening of the ship channel](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fh79t) (1878)

Width and length: 97 x 21cm, Aspect ratio: 4.61

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:4m90fh80k/full/3500,/0/default.jpg" >}}

This river profile, published in 1878, documents the importance of the St. Lawrence River to the urban network of southeastern Canada. Clocking in at a formidable aspect ratio of 4.6, [this chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fh79t) depicts a wide range different data, including:

* Blue "low water level": lowest level water could be; want river floor deep enough the largest/heaviest ship would not get stuck (they decided 25' deep)
* Black outline: original floor depth
* Shaded red: what's been removed to make floor 23' deep
* Crosshatched red: what still needs to be removed to make floor 25' deep

The map highlights the centrality of long, natural features—like the St. Lawrence River—to 19th century urban economies. The river had to be dredged in order to make the landscape navigable for larger vessels, which would improve the productive capacities of the region. Meanwhile, the dredging itself created its own constellation of economic activity; as the map notes under the “Ship Channel” header in the top-right hand corner, the monetary “Expenditure for 20 ft. of depth” totaled $1.2 million in 1878, over $38 million today when adjusted for inflation.

#### James F. Baldwin, [A plan & profile of the Boston & Lowell Railroad](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161b444)  \[1836?]

Width and length: 101 x 20cm, Aspect ratio: 5.5

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161b45d/full/3500,/0/default.jpg" >}}

Railroads and canals feature prominently in the category of “long maps,” and oftentimes, these long landscapes appear beside one another in the same maps. Such is the case with [this 1836 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161b444) of the Boston & Lowell (B\&L) Railroad, in which the railroad itself follows the contours of the Middlesex Canal (labeled “M. Canal” or just “Canal”). The B\&L Railroad Company incorporated in 1830 and faced pushback from the canal investors, who feared the railroad would render their canal obsolete. These economic disputes translated to political ones, as railroad companies needed to convince the Massachusetts state legislature to fund their projects. In the original charter of the B\&L Railroad Company states:

“no other railroad than the one hereby granted, shall, within thirty years from and after the passing of this act, be authorized to be made, leading from Boston, Charlestown, or Cambridge, to Lowell, or from Boston, Charlestown, or Cambridge, to any place within five miles of the northern termination of the railroad hereby authorized to be made.”

In other words, this long map also depicts how geography and monopoly intersected on the tracks of a railroad.

#### Nantasket Beach Steamboat Company, *[Boston to Nantasket Beach and Plymouth](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fq413)* \[ca. 1915]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fq42c/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Through the early 20th century, Hull became famous for Nantasket Beach and Paragon Park, which attracted summer vacationers from all over Greater Boston. The Nantasket Beach Steamboat Company grew a successful business by bringing passengers from Boston and Hingham via ferry across Boston Harbor. The steamboat company also ran to Plymouth, offering easy access to a quiet retreat on the historic waterfront.

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fq413) was originally part of a promotional pamphlet advertising the Nantasket Beach Steamboat Company’s service to these fashionable summer destinations. Paragon Park has since closed, but Nantasket Beach continues to be a popular summertime beach destination. 

The MBTA runs regular commuter ferry service to Hull as part of the Hingham-Hull-Logan Airport-Boston route, which expands the utility of the ferry beyond vacationing. Today, there is no ferry service connecting Boston to Plymouth.

#### Boston & Gloucester Steamship Co., *[Boston & Gloucester Steamboat Co.: summer season 1889](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp956)* (1889)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fp96g/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Seaside retreats and ferries that toured the coastlines have been popular summer vacation activities since the advent of the steamboat. In the late 1800s, Gloucester was a popular long-distance ferry destination for Bostonians. [This brochure](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp956) was distributed in the summer of 1889 by the Boston & Gloucester Steamboat Company to promote its recreational ferry service to Gloucester. These trips were just as much about sight-seeing from the ferry as they were about reaching the vacation destination.

Today, taking a ferry to one of Greater Boston’s many quaint coastal towns is still one of the summer’s best activities to do on the water. The MBTA runs ferries to Hull, which is most well known for the beautiful Nantasket Beach. Boston Harbor City Cruises also runs private, long-distance ferries to Provincetown via the Cape Cod Fast Ferry out of Downtown Boston and Salem. Alternatively, you can also get to the Cape from Boston’s Seaport via Bay State Cruise Company’s Provincetown Fast Ferry.
