[This map of Africa](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4637430) is usually juxtaposed with another Africa, to compare rainfall in January to rainfall in July. The July rains, shown here, are centered on the area just south of the Sahara desert, whereas January rains have their centerpoint further south. The place names on this map are from 1913, when many Europeans referred to the areas by their colonial names. Rhodesia, for example, is on this map, but is now Zimbabwe. Mapmakers can have specific biases and agendas with their maps, and it's important to recognize what those are. These cartographers were representing a colonial territory that they wanted to measure and study, likely for commercial gain.

More than a century earlier, the American colonies had gained their independence from Great Britain.
