We are thrilled to announce that we have been awarded a Library of Congress Teaching with Primary Sources (TPS) Regional Grant! The Library’s TPS Regional program promotes the widespread, sustained and effective use of primary sources from the Library of Congress by increasing access to the Library and to TPS program resources. We're grateful to the Library, and folks at Waynesbury University. Our award is from the Eastern Region Program, coordinated by Waynesburg University

This grant will support our 2023 exhibition on community stories found in urban atlases. Using urban atlases from the Leventhal Center's collection and from the Library of Congress, as well as other historical ephemera.

In addition to a free public exhibition, teacher tools, K-12 curricular development, professional development opportunities for educators, public programming and events, and high school student engagement with exhibition curation and interpretation.

Fire insurance and real estate atlases of the late 19th and early 20th centuries—what we collectively call urban atlases—form one of the most extraordinary sources of richly detailed historical information about local change during a period of dramatic industrialization, immigration, and social change in US cities.

Identify your primary audience (K-12 in-service educators, pre-service teachers, etc. depending on your local TPS project's focus) 

● Describe the types of opportunities you provide (e.g. professional development for teachers, after-school programming, etc.) 

● Name project partners (e.g. local schools and organizations you work with and/or specific geographic areas of coverage)
