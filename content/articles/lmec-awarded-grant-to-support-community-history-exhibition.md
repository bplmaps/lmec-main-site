We are thrilled to announce that we have been awarded a **Library of Congress Teaching with Primary Sources (TPS) Regional Grant!** The Library’s [TPS Regional program](https://www.loc.gov/programs/teachers/about-this-program/teaching-with-primary-sources-partner-program/tps-regional-grant-program/) promotes the widespread, sustained and effective use of primary sources from the Library of Congress by increasing access to the Library and to TPS program resources. Our award is from the Eastern Region Program, coordinated by Waynesburg University.

Fire insurance and real estate atlases of the late 19th and early 20th centuries—what we collectively call urban atlases—form one of the most extraordinary sources of richly detailed historical information about local change during a period of dramatic industrialization, immigration, and social change in US cities. The exhibition will showcase how these resources can be used to narrate community-driven stories about the past. In addition to urban atlases from the Leventhal Center's collection, the exhibition will also showcase atlases from the Library of Congress's extensive collection, interactives from [Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/), and other historical ephemera and non-cartographic primary sources such as photographs, deeds, land records, newspaper clippings, and manuscripts that help to tell the stories of local change.

In addition to a free in-person public exhibition, the project will incorporate public talks, K-12 teacher workshops, classroom visits, digital resources for teachers, and curation and interpretation from high school student in Boston Public Schools. It will also offer opportunities for community organizations to develop their own interpretive materials.

We look forward to working with our partners from Boston Public Schools, local community and historical institutions, and BPL Branch Libraries, and are grateful to the Library and TPS for this opportunity.
