We recently digitized our [Boston Redevelopment Authority Collection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?f%5Bcollection_name_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Boston+Redevelopment+Authority+Collection) and are diving deep into one of its maps today! This map of the city of Boston focuses on tourism and getting visitors into and around the city to see the sights. It's a two-sided brochure with a variety of maps and other images on it that show different ways of visualizing Boston from a tourist perspective.

The first section is a map of Greater Boston with advice on getting in and out of the city from different directions, assuming an audience of car owners. "It is most advisable to stop and ask directions," the creators of this map suggest. Indeed, Boston is a difficult city to navigate, and for many of us it's hard to imagine learning how for the first time without a GPS! This map was created in 1982, though, a time when oral, pre-written, and map directions would have to suffice without real-time adjustments or reminders of when to turn.

Once you arrive in Boston, the map provided for you by the creators of this brochure is a city map! There are two ways to look at the map of the public transit system. One is the larger map here, which shows the approximate layout of the actual train tunnels and tracks through the city. The other way to visualize the T is the more abstracted map we see in the inset, which is very similar to today's T map.
