We recently digitized our [Boston Redevelopment Authority Collection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?f%5Bcollection_name_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Boston+Redevelopment+Authority+Collection) and are diving deep into one of its maps today! This map of the city of Boston focuses on tourism and getting visitors into and around the city to see the sights. It's a two-sided brochure with a variety of maps and other images on it that show different ways of visualizing Boston from a tourist perspective.

The first section is a map of Greater Boston with advice on getting in and out of the city, assuming an audience of car owners. "It is most advisable to stop and ask directions," the creators of this map suggest. Indeed, Boston is a difficult city to navigate, and for many of us it's hard to imagine learning how for the first time without a GPS! This 1982 map was created in a time when in-person and map directions would have to suffice.
