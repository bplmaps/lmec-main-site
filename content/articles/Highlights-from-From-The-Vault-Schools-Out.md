> On June 9, we hosted [From The Vault: School's Out](https://www.leventhalmap.org/event/from-the-vault-collections-showing-/)! From The Vault is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Map Center staff. For this edition the series, we looked at objects that were created for or within a school environment.

##### Nathaniel G. Huntington, The Common School Atlas (1836) and J. A. Cummings, School Atlas to Cummings' Ancient & Modern Geography (1821)

These two school atlases from the early decades of the 19th century provided visual aids in the form of maps to supplement geography textbooks. At this time, geography textbooks were constructed as catechisms – long passages of text from which the student was to read from then answer questions. These paragraphs on countries listed places and natural features such as mountains and rivers. This type of rote memorization was common in teaching methods of the time. The school atlases displayed here contain maps which would help students answer questions, and illustrations which depict historical events to supplement their geographical learning.

##### Isaac Moore, The Eagle Map of the United States (1833)

This unique map from a 1833 geography book, Rudiments of National Knowledge, shows the states in outline color with an eagle sitting on top of the nation. Intended to teach geography, children could memorize the location of the states by referring to parts of the bird, such as the talons which represent Florida. Indigenous to North America, the bald eagle became the national bird of the United States in 1782, symbolizing strength, courage and freedom. Relating the Nation’s geography to a representation of national identity solidified the importance of geographic education at the time.

##### David W. McCord, History 2 (1914)

Progressive 19th-century educators such as Emma Willard and William Channing Woodbridge emphasized the importance of teaching history and geography simultaneously. This practice, which continued into the early 20th century, is evident in the notebook of Lincoln High School student David McCord, displayed here. David’s book from his history class in 1914 contains notes with corresponding maps, such as those related to the Roman Empire. Historical maps allowed students to visualize places in the past, as David’s map of the Holy Roman Empire does.
