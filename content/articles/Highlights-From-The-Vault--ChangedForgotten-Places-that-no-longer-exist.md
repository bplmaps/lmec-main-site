> *On May 2, we hosted **From The Vault — Changed/Forgotten: Places That No Longer Exist.***

As Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month begins, this *From The Vault* examines the ways maps can support and inform Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander history across the globe and what it means for a map to be truly representative of a place and its people.

#### William Hemsley Emory, [Map of Texas and the country adjacent](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90f684t) (1844)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:4m90f6853/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Published the year before Texas was annexed and became the 28th state of the USA, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90f684t) depicts the short-lived country of the Republic of Texas. Recognized as a country between 1836 and 1844, Texas had gained its independence from Mexico, though they were considered more of a “rebellious province” as the Mexican Congress refused to recognize the independence of the Republic of Texas. As seen, the borders of the Republic extend much further than the current state of Texas, reaching as far north as Wyoming and as far west as New Mexico. In practice, much of the Republic’s claimed territory was occupied by the Comanche people and outside the control of any country.

***Though the Republic of Texas only existed for a short while, how did it go on to impact the future of the territory it occupied?***

#### Richard Rummell, [New York City : the business center of the borough of Manhattan](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fn331) (1905)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:4m90fn349/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This era of New York is no longer visible under the skyscrapers and modern changes the city has undergone in the last century. Some of the largest physical changes to the city are reflected in the total demolition and rebuilding of some of the city’s most historic buildings and neighborhoods.

Buildings like the New York Produce Exchange (which brought in $15 million a day in business by 1900) and others obscured by the angle of [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fn331), like Madison Square Garden, the Singer Building, the original Waldorf and Astoria hotels amongst many others, were eventually demolished to make way for the “City of Dreams”. The Empire State Building, New York Penn Station, and the current iteration of Madison Square Garden are all built on the sites of what were once thought of as some of the most amazing architecture in the United States.

Is it possible to grow, expand, and modernize without rebuilding the oldest parts of a city?

#### John Wesley Powell, [Linguistic families of American Indians north of Mexico](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149w93v) \[1907?]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149w944/full/,1400/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Originally displayed at Chicago's 1893 World Fair, [this reconstructed map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149w93v) shows the distribution of major Indigenous language families at the time of European contact. Most maps published in the 1890s only depicted Indian reservations, but this map recognized that Native people originally controlled and inhabited all of North America. While not fully representative of every language spoken by the indigenous North American people, this breathe of Native language is much more difficult to find in the current day.

Due to the harmful action of the American government, like outlawing the use of Native languages and the forced removal of Indigenous children from their homes and into government-run (and oftentimes, physically abusive) boarding schools, the amount of fluent speakers of indigenous languages had drastically decreased. Approximately 170 to 175 Native American languages are still spoken in the US today, down from the estimated 300+ languages spoken before European contact. Many of these languages are facing endangerment, with some estimates suggesting that only 20 will remain by 2050 without significant intervention.

#### ***[Map of Seoul](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:kh04p666z)*** (1890)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:kh04p6677/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Seoul has been the capital city of Korea for more than six hundred years, though the city’s history traces back to 18 BC. Seoul, like the entire Korean peninsula, is surrounded by mountains. The ring of mountains that surround the city are presented here in an elevated three-quarters view similar to traditional East Asian landscape painting.

The viewer positioned on any given side reads the names written in Korean characters on the opposite side of [the map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:kh04p666z), as the characters on the side closest will read upside down. This creates a unique perspective and manner of considering mapped space when compared to European styles of mapping, but were a common feature found in maps of East Asia from this time period. Seven foreign embassies are indicated on the map, those of the United States, England, France, Germany, Russia, China and Japan are indicative of the country’s growing connection to the broader world.

#### ***[\[Map of New England, 31st\]](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd376308v)*** \[1850–1870]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:wd3763094/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" >}}

By the mid to late 1880s, Japan was opening itself up to vast international trade after almost  200 years of being closed to nearly all foreigners, due in large part to heavy military pressure from the United States, Russia, Britain, France, and Holland. This map can be interpreted as the desire from the Japanese to learn more about important harbors and industrial ports in the United States, who were both consumers and aggressors to Japan. 

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd376308v) includes depiction of New England, with an inset of Boston, and descriptions of Boston Harbor, Rhode Island, Hartford, CT, and manufacturing in Lowell, MA.

#### Gregor Noetzel, ***[Asia, Japan and Korea with the surrounding seas and the adjacent coastal region of China : from the latest information](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:31982x20m)*** (1904)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:c821mx46k/full/1400,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This 1904 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:31982x20m) captures a very unique point in Japan’s history. In the previous 50 years, Japan had gone from a primarily agricultural country with little technological development, national military, and access to foreign nations to a highly “modernized” country united under a central government, a nationalized education system, a well-developed transport and communication system, and a highly powerful military force. Just after the publishing of this map, Japan would cement its power amongst European countries by defeating Russia and gaining control over Korea.
