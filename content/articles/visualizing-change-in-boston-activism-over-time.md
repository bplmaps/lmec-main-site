> Hey, educators! This article digs into a case study from our latest [Digital Commonwealth](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/) primary source set, [Activism in Boston Over Time](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/for_educators/primary_source_sets/activism_in_boston_over_time). In the set, you will find a collection of maps, photographs, film, and documents that reveal change over time in different Boston neighborhoods and the role of activism in creating that change. Linked [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PUi7o35Y-6EPGe0dOq8wi9jmj5C78Md7qrLn6ZVoIOE/edit#slide=id.p) is a lesson that incorporates many of these sources as well as others that can be used with students in grades 8-12.

### The Metropolitan Master Highway Plan of 1948

In 1948, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts released the [Metropolitan Master Highway Plan](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/n15/mode/1up), a “ten-year construction program for the relief of traffic congestion” detailing “a network of expressways of latest modern design and of sufficient capacity.” Included in the 204-page report are [cost estimates](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/102/mode/1up), [economic justifications](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/103/mode/1up), [traffic tables](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/114/mode/1up), and maps of [proposed expressways](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/124/mode/1up), [construction stages](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/106/mode/1up), and more.

Maguire and Associates of Boston, J. E. Greiner Company of Baltimore, and De Leuw, Cather & Company of Chicago." class="figure-right" >}}

The proposed [complete system of expressways](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/8/mode/1up) included the [Southwest Expressway](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/53/mode/1up), beginning at the business district of Boston and running through Roxbury, Dorchester, and Hyde Park through Milton and Dedham, and the [Belt Route](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/60/mode/1up) to serve as a bypass of the central area for traffic east to west and north to south. Designed to span through densely-populated areas inside and outside of Boston, both projects were eventually halted and abandoned in the early 1970s.

The following maps, photographs, and reports document the course from proposal to abandonment—a decision that can be attributed to widespread public opposition and action.

#### Inner Belt

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9019vk684/3985,3130,1365,1288/full/0/default.jpg" caption="The proposed Inner Belt appears on [this 1961 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cn69pp161) in two dashed, green lines." class="figure-right" >}}

The Inner Belt was planned as an 8-lane expressway that, in tandem with the Central Artery, would form a [ring road](https://historycambridge.org/innerbelt/history.html) around the metropolitan area, cutting through Roxbury and Fenway, crossing the Charles River, and then running through [Cambridgeport, Central Square, and Somerville](https://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2012/03/26/inner-belt-highways).

As depicted on [this 1959 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c17h) of the "golden semicircle," it was designed to {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fn107c18s/2840,1021,1083,927/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} encircle the city {{</popup>}} but in result, would completely destroy neighborhoods and uproot thousands. These populated areas were [described](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/44/mode/1up) by planners as neighborhoods where {{< popup src="https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/masterhighwaypla00char$60/145,501,1533,1140/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} real estate values {{</popup>}} were "low and...still declining," and even suggested the "new service provided by the expressway" would "arrest the deterioration" and "aid in their rehabilitation." In many cases, the neighborhoods identified as "declining" were racially and culturally diverse, working-class communities that, once completed, would bear the brunt of environmental and health concerns from automotive pollution.

> This geographic mismatch between one group of people’s needs and another group’s exposure is a key element of **environmental injustice**. Geographers use the term [**sacrifice zones**](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/topics/sacrifice-zones/) to describe places that have been severely impaired by toxic landscapes.

As planned, the Inner Belt was projected to not only disrupt public transit and intensify noise pollution, but also displace over [13,000 people](https://www.cambridgema.gov/historic/cambridgehistory/innerbelthistory), local businesses, and fragment communities. With these concerns in mind, public opposition became vocal in the mid-1960s, with organized efforts in both Cambridge and Roxbury.

On February 26, 1966 a group of Cambridge residents gathered in front of Cambridge City Hall to ... 

Adults and children, wrapped in winter layers, marched with signs that read {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1v53k261r/3749,388,686,703/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} Save Our Homes, {{</popup>}} {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1v53k261r/2968,847,839,839/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} Ain't I Worth More Than the Inner Belt,{{</popup>}} and {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1v53k259q/848,1379,1344,1078/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} 5,000 People Are Worth More Than Two Miles Of Road. {</popup>}}
