> Hey, educators! This article digs into a case study from our latest [Digital Commonwealth](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/) primary source set, [Activism in Boston Over Time](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/for_educators/primary_source_sets/activism_in_boston_over_time). In the set, you will find a collection of maps, photographs, film, and documents that reveal change over time in different Boston neighborhoods and the role of activism in creating that change. Linked [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PUi7o35Y-6EPGe0dOq8wi9jmj5C78Md7qrLn6ZVoIOE/edit#slide=id.p) is a lesson that incorporates many of these sources as well as others that can be used with students in grades 8-12.

### The Metropolitan Master Highway Plan of 1948

In 1948, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works released the [Metropolitan Master Highway Plan](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/n15/mode/1up), a “ten-year construction program for the relief of traffic congestion” detailing “a network of expressways of latest modern design and of sufficient capacity.” Included in the 204-page report are [cost estimates](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/102/mode/1up), [economic justifications](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/103/mode/1up), [traffic tables](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/114/mode/1up), and maps of [proposed expressways](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/124/mode/1up), [construction stages](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/106/mode/1up), and more.

Maguire and Associates of Boston, J. E. Greiner Company of Baltimore, and De Leuw, Cather & Company of Chicago." class="figure-right" >}}

The proposed [complete system](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/8/mode/1up) of expressways included the [Southwest Expressway](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/53/mode/1up), beginning at the business district of Boston and running through Roxbury, Dorchester, and Hyde Park through Milton and Dedham, and the [Belt Route](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/60/mode/1up) to serve as a bypass for traffic east to west and north to south. Designed to span through densely-populated areas inside and outside of Boston, both projects were eventually halted and abandoned in the early 1970s.

The following maps, photographs, and reports document the course from proposal to abandonment—a decision that can be attributed to widespread public opposition and action.

#### Inner Belt

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9019vk684/3985,3130,1365,1288/full/0/default.jpg" caption="The proposed Inner Belt appears on [this 1961 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cn69pp161) in two dashed, green lines." class="figure-right" >}}

The Inner Belt was planned as an 8-lane expressway that, in tandem with the Central Artery, would form a [ring road](https://historycambridge.org/innerbelt/history.html) around the metropolitan area, cutting through Roxbury and Fenway, crossing the Charles River, and then running through [Cambridgeport, Central Square, and Somerville](https://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2012/03/26/inner-belt-highways).

As depicted on [this 1959 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:fn107c17h) of the "golden semicircle," it was designed to {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fn107c18s/2840,1021,1083,927/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} encircle the city{{</popup>}}  but in result, would completely destroy neighborhoods and uproot thousands. These populated areas were [described](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/44/mode/1up) by planners as neighborhoods where {{< popup src="https://iiif.archivelab.org/iiif/masterhighwaypla00char$60/145,501,1533,1140/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} real estate values{{</popup>}}  were "low and...still declining," and even suggested the "new service provided by the expressway" would "arrest the deterioration" and "aid in their rehabilitation." In many cases, the neighborhoods identified as "declining" were racially and culturally diverse, working-class communities that, once completed, would bear the brunt of environmental and health concerns from automotive pollution.

> This geographic mismatch between one group of people’s needs and another group’s exposure is a key element of **environmental injustice**. Geographers use the term [**sacrifice zones**](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/topics/sacrifice-zones/) to describe places that have been severely impaired by toxic landscapes.

As planned, the Inner Belt was projected to not only disrupt public transit and intensify noise pollution, but also displace over [13,000 people](https://www.cambridgema.gov/historic/cambridgehistory/innerbelthistory), local businesses, and fragment communities. With these concerns in mind, public opposition vocalized in the mid-1960s, with organized efforts in both Cambridge and Roxbury.

On February of 1966, a group of residents, led by {{< popup src="/uploads/2022-09-13/screen-shot-2020-10-26-at-9-35-26-pm.png"  target="blank" >}} Anstis Benfield,{{</popup>}}  gathered in front of Cambridge City Hall to express their opposition. Adults and children, wrapped in winter layers, marched with signs that read {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1v53k261r/3600,266,850,1127/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} Save Our Homes{{</popup>}}  or {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1v53k261r/1627,789,1109,1113/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} Rights Not Roads{{</popup>}}  and {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1v53k259q/681,1088,1774,1935/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} 5,000 People Are Worth More Than Two Miles Of Road.{{</popup>}}  Before concluding, the group presented City Councilor Walter Sullivan with a signed petition calling the plan "[inhumane](https://historycambridge.org/self-guided-tours/self-guided-tour-women-activists-of-riverside-50-years-after-suffrage/)" and demanding the highway be relocated to displace fewer families.

Later that year, demonstrators organized once again—this time at the inauguration ceremony of the new Massachusetts Institute of Technology president, Howard Johnson, where over 4,000 people (including presidents of [57 U.S. universities and colleges](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:5138kc40t)) were in attendance. Again, adults and children, labelled as [picketers](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:5138kc481), marched with signs reading {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:5138kc55f/1177,955,1307,1347/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} Beat The Belt{{</popup>}}  and demanding support and action from {{< popup src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:5138kc51b/1925,499,692,843/full/0/default.jpg"  target="blank" >}} President Johnson.{{</popup>}}

#### Southwest Expressway

On the other side of the Charles River, residents in Roxbury mobilized efforts around not only the Inner Belt proposal, but also plans for the Southwest Expressway. The Expressway was designed as a [twelve-lane extension](https://www.bostonpreservation.org/news-item/tiny-story-southwest-corridor-park) of I-95 to relieve traffic congestion on Washington Street and Blue Hill Avenue, running through Milton, Hyde Park, Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, and the South End.

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h14cv99n/full/full/0/default.jpg" caption="[This 1964 map](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:7h14cv973) accompanied a report to determine the extent displacement if the Southwest Expressway were completed." class="figure-center" >}}

Starting in 1966, more than [500 homes and businesses](https://www.bostonpreservation.org/news-item/tiny-story-southwest-corridor-park) between Forest Hills and the South End, including Jackson Square and Roxbury Crossing, were cleared for the Expressway; once again, the affected residents were generally from "[lower income, multiracial communities](https://www.bu.edu/ioc/news/news-events/people-before-highways/)" who "did not drive cars," yet "it was their neighborhoods and communities that were...destroyed in an effort to make Boston more accessible to those living in the wealthier suburbs." 

In the face of such destruction and displacement, opposition efforts were quick to mobilize. One group, the Roxbury-based {{< popup src="/uploads/2022-09-14/screen-shot-2022-09-14-at-10-43-38-am.png"  target="blank" >}} Black United Front,{{</popup>}}  in a statement of demands, [wrote](https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:cj82m3654): {{< figure src="/uploads/2022-09-14/screen-shot-2022-09-14-at-10-44-52-am.png" caption="" class="figure-center" >}}

In Jamaica Plain, a group of residents formed the [JP Expressway Committee](https://www.jphs.org/20th-century/how-jamaica-plain-activists-created-the-southwest-corridor.html) and collectively attended public hearings, wrote letters, and were responsible for the
