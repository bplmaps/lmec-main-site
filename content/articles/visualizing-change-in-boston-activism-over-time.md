#### Southwest Corridor

The Southwest Expressway and Inner Belt Highway projects were both proposed in the Master Highway Plan for the Boston Metropolitan Area in 1948. Designed to span through densely-populated areas inside and outside of Boston, both projects were eventually halted and abandoned in the early 1970s.

#### Tent City

On April 27, 1968, hundreds of demonstrators erected a four-day tent city on the lot of a proposed parking garage to protest urban renewal projects in Boston’s South End. Support for the protest forced the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) to abandon their building plans, and over 20 years later, the lot now houses 269 units of mixed-income housing.

#### Dudley Triangle

In 1984, Dudley residents formed the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative in hopes of reclaiming and revitalizing their neighborhood. In the following years, the DSNI launched a Community Land Trust––Dudley Neighbors, Incorporated––and established community control over 1,300 parcels of vacant land. Now known as the Dudley Triangle, the land holds 225 affordable homes, urban farm sites, a community greenhouse, playgrounds, gardens, and more.

#### Parcel C

In the 1960s, the City of Boston demolished homes and buildings in Chinatown as part of ongoing urban renewal projects. Over the next few decades, community organizations, referendums, and protests blocked construction plans of a 600-car parking garage for Tufts and New England Medical Center. In 2003, Parcel C became home to the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center community center, 251 housing units, and new offices for the Asian Community Development Corporation.
