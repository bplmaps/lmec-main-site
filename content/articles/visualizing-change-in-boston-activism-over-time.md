> Hey, educators! This article digs into a case study from our latest [Digital Commonwealth](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/) primary source set, [Activism in Boston Over Time](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/for_educators/primary_source_sets/activism_in_boston_over_time). You will find a collection of maps, photographs, film, and documents that reveal change over time in different Boston neighborhoods and the role of activism in creating that change. Linked [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PUi7o35Y-6EPGe0dOq8wi9jmj5C78Md7qrLn6ZVoIOE/edit#slide=id.p) is a lesson that incorporates many of these sources as well as others that can be used with students in grades 8-12.
