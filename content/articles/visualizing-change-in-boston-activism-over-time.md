> Hey, educators! This article digs into a case study from our latest [Digital Commonwealth](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/) primary source set, [Activism in Boston Over Time](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/for_educators/primary_source_sets/activism_in_boston_over_time). You will find a collection of maps, photographs, film, and documents that reveal change over time in different Boston neighborhoods and the role of activism in creating that change. Linked [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PUi7o35Y-6EPGe0dOq8wi9jmj5C78Md7qrLn6ZVoIOE/edit#slide=id.p) is a lesson that incorporates many of these sources as well as others that can be used with students in grades 8-12.

In 1948, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts released the [Metropolitan Master Highway Plan](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/n15/mode/1up), a “ten-year construction program for the relief of traffic congestion” detailing “a network of expressways of latest modern design and of sufficient capacity.” Included in the 204-page report are [cost estimates](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/102/mode/1up), [economic justifications](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/103/mode/1up), [traffic tables](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/114/mode/1up), and maps of [proposed expressways](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/124/mode/1up), [construction stages](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/106/mode/1up), and more. 

The proposed [complete system of expressways](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/8/mode/1up) included a [Southwest Expressway](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/53/mode/1up), beginning at the business district of Boston and running through Roxbury, Dorchester, and Hyde Park through Milton and Dedham, and a [Belt Route](https://archive.org/details/masterhighwaypla00char/page/60/mode/1up) to serve as a by-pass of the central area for traffic east to west and north to south. Designed to span through densely-populated areas inside and outside of Boston, both projects were eventually halted and abandoned in the early 1970s. The following maps, photographs, and reports document the course from proposal to abandonment, a decision that is heavily attributed to public opposition and action.
