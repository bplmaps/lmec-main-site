title = "The Maps of Dumont de Montigny"

+++
Dumont de Montigny was a French colonial officer stationed in Louisiana in the early 18th century. He spent nearly 18 years there and wrote an extensive history of the place, published in 1747, which included these beautiful maps of encampments, forts, farmland, and more. These maps are in the physical collection at the [Newberry Library](https://www.newberry.org/). Check them all out [in our digital collections](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?f%5Bname_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Dumont+de+Montigny), after you peruse these three below!

### Fort du Billoxy

Fort Maurepas, on the Gulf of Mexico, was also known as Fort Biloxi, spelled a variety of ways. In this sort of organically laid out [map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vn507), Dumont has labeled residential barracks, the government building (which may have been the seat of French Louisiana, when Biloxi was the capital), the well, cypress marshes, and more. The time he depicts is 1720; today the fort is within the town of Ocean Springs, Mississippi.

### Land "Cessions"

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:z603vn69z/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="Dumont de Montigny. [Concession des Chaoüachas appartenante cy devant a Mgr. le duc de Belleisle et associez](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vn68p). 1747." class="figure-left" >}}

This map title begins "Concession des Chaoüachas," which means Chaoüacha land grant or ceded land. It is unlikely that the Chaoüachas saw themselves as willingly ceding land to the French. On the contrary, [Alan Gallay describes](https://books.google.com/books?id=ikISTgwRAYMC&pg=PA297&lpg=PA297&dq=Chaou%CC%88achas&source=bl&ots=N85Q9aOaHV&sig=ACfU3U3BgxFH6rbV2-sjNNXAuulNUkxWKw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi81pLR_57xAhV7RzABHSMfCLsQ6AEwEnoECAUQAw#v=onepage&q=Chaou%CC%88achas&f=false) them as one of the "petite nations" that was raided and attacked, and its inhabitants enslaved, by other native groups on behalf of the English. [The map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vn68p) itself is much more geometric than the previous one, with irrigation systems flowing at right angles through square fields. It shows a plantation on Saint Catherine Creek in Natchez, Mississippi. The plantation formed part of Charles Louis Auguste Fouquet, duc de Belle-Isle's land concessions in provincial Louisiana.

### Battle Map

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:z603vn65v/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="Dumont de Montigny. [\[Campement\] de l'armée franc̦oise \[devant u\]n village des ennemis, les Chicachas le 26 \[de mais\] 1736](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vn64k). 1747." class="figure-right" >}}

Finally, this [map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vn64k) makes direct reference to some of the violence skimmed over with the word "concession" in the previous map. It depicts the Battle of Ackia, detailing a failed 1736 attack by Choctaw and French allies led by Jean Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville against a Chickasaw village and English allies. This battle was fought about 7 miles northwest of the later site of Tupelo in Lee County, Mississippi.
