> *On July 25, we hosted **From The Vault — Historic Currents: Charting the Evolution of Boston’s Ferry Routes**, in collaboration with [A Better City](https://www.abettercity.org/), [Seaport Transportation Management Association](https://www.seaporttma.org/) and the [Lower Mystic Transportation Management Association](https://www.lowermystictma.com/)**.***

**Did you know that the oldest ferry service in the United States was the Winnisimmet Ferry, which was founded in 1631 and transported passengers between the North End and Chelsea?**

The maps chosen for *Historic Currents* helped patrons to learn about how transportation hubs, industries, and the destinations characterizing Greater Boston communities led the way for a variety of successful ferry routes.

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd376810x) provides a holistic illustration of how ferries contributed to the transportation landscape at the onset of the 20th Century.

In 1902, railroads and steamboats were the predominant method of shipping freight and moving passengers. To make regional or long-distance connections more efficient, rail and boat terminals were often built in proximity to each other and were sometimes run by the same transportation companies. At this time, bridges were noticeably absent and ferries served as quick connections between hubs across the Mystic River and Boston Harbor.

The Boston and Maine Railroad & M.S.S. Co. Ferry spanned the Mystic River to connect passengers between the railroad’s Mystic Wharf terminal and the New England Gas & Coke Company plant in Everett. The Winnisimmet Ferry connected the North End and Chelsea and the East Boston Ferries connected the wharves of Downtown Boston with the Boston & Maine and Boston & Albany railroad terminals in East Boston. In addition to these local ferry services, dozens of steamboat companies operated along Boston’s waterfront, transporting passengers locally and abroad.

Today, most shipping transport is done by truck, virtually eliminating the need for many of the terminals in this map. Ferry terminals also disappeared along with the rail hubs, and for decades, there was no boat service that brought passengers across the Mystic River. Now, only the Encore Hotel water shuttle makes the connection back and forth across the river. Fortunately, the MBTA and Seaport Ferries continue to make robust service stops at docks in Downtown Boston, the Seaport, Charlestown, and East Boston.

Shirley railroad: steamboat lines and connections: established for the purpose of developing the most popular seashore resort on the Atlantic Coast](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd376689p) \[1880–1889]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9k41zj64q/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Depicted is [the plan for the Eastern Junction, Broad Sound Pier, & Point Shirley Railroad](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd376689p) at the time of its charter in 1880.

In the late 1870s, Revere Beach became a popular summer retreat for families in Boston and surrounding urban neighborhoods. Initially, the Boston, Revere Beach, & Lynn Narrow-Gauge Railroad was the main transport option for visitors. However, the Eastern Junction, Broad Sound Pier, & Point Shirley company began chartering multiple ferry routes to bring vacationers to the beach. It ran steamboat ferries from Long Wharf, Central Wharf, and Rowes Wharf to Winthrop Landing and Point Shirley, as well as an additional ferry between Lynn Harbor and Broad Sound Pier in Revere.

The branch line operated for three years “for the purpose of developing the most popular seashore resort on the Atlantic Coast.” In the fall of 1883, both railroads and their associated ferry services merged into the Boston, Winthrop, and Shore Railroad. In 1896, Revere Beach was reopened as the first public beach in the United States. Regional rail and ferry service to Revere and Winthrop’s beaches continued until 1940 and it can still be reached by public transit via the MBTA’s Blue Line. The beach’s early success as a seaside destination wouldn’t have been possible without the charter ferries and railroads whisking passengers up and down the coastline.

#### Geo. H. Walker & Co, [Map showing the routes of The Winthrop Steamboat Co](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x059cc723) \[ca. 1896]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:b85162086/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x059cc723) reads: “During the season of 1896, The Winthrop Steamboat Co. will run its boats O. E. Lewis and Winthrop regularly, weather permitting, between Boston and Winthrop, and its new boat, Cottage Park between Boston and Cottage Park. With its increased facilities for doing business, the Company expects to accommodate its patrons as never before. Official Running Time will be announced later.”

The Winthrop Steamboat Company made a convenient connection to Downtown Boston for Winthrop residents who had work or business there, and served as a primary connection to the Boston, Winthrop, and Shore Railroad to bring city beachgoers to Winthrop and Revere’s beaches during the summer months. In this regard, the Winthrop Steamboat Company replaced ferry service that had once been provided by the Eastern Junction, Broad Sound Pier, & Point Shirley Railroad prior to its merger with the other short line railroads branching off the Eastern Railroad.

Today, the MBTA runs full 7-day service to Winthrop between 6:40am and 7:15pm, making a loop of stops at Winthrop Landing, Logan Airport, Central Wharf, and Seaport/Fan Pier. Weekend service runs from 9am until 8:10pm and combines service with the Quincy Ferry.

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9k41zj58k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

[This 1901 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3760753) was on the front cover of a pamphlet called “Bird’s Eye View of Boston Harbor and the South Shore to Provincetown Showing Steamboat Routes.”

The pamphlet was sponsored by the New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad, which at the time, owned and operated a passenger rail and steamboat service on the South Shore and south coast—what was then known as the “Old Colony Railroad.” The aim of the pamphlet was to encourage tourism to the areas south of Boston, and this cover provided a beautiful rendition of the South Shore. Primary steamboat lines are depicted on the map: Boston to Plymouth, Provincetown, and New York. These steamboats served to make tourism and regional vacationing more accessible to the middle class.

#### Joseph F.W. Des Barres, *[A sketch of the operations before Charlestown the capital of South Carolina](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149x77p)* (1780)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149x78z/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" >}}

In 1780, the British tried to capture Charleston, South Carolina ***again***. [This chart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149x77p) depicts the six-week siege that forced American troops to surrender on May 12, 1780. This was the largest surrender of American troops during the war. Along with Samuel Holland, Joseph F.W. Des Barres conducted extensive coastal surveys of the British colonies beginning in 1764. Although their charts were prepared primarily for navigational purposes, this one features the fortifications constructed by British and American troops (colored yellow) and the British and American fleets. 

This version of the chart appeared in Des Barres’ *The Atlantic Neptune*, the most comprehensive maritime atlas of the period.

#### Michel Capitaine du Chesnoy, *[Carte de l'affaire de Montmouth, ou le Général Washington commandon l'armée Americaine, et le Général Clinton l'armée Angloise le 28 Juin 1778](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vw18x)* (1778)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:z603vw196/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Michel Capitaine du Chesnoy, the Marquis de Lafayette’s map maker, drew [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vw18x) following the Battle of Monmouth Courthouse in northeastern New Jersey. After confusion surrounding the Continental Army’s orders, the soldiers prevented the British troops from advancing. The battle occurred on a hot June day and hundreds of soldiers died of heatstroke. Women, who came to be referred to collectively as “Molly Pitcher,” supported the American troops by bringing water to cool the men and their guns. Although the battle ended inconclusively, it was a turning point for the professionalization of the American army as volunteer French and German military officers provided training.

#### Andrew Ellicott, *[Plan of the city of Washington in the territory of Columbia, ceded by the states of Virginia and Maryland to the United States of America, and by them established as the seat of their government, after the year MDCC](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vs02d)* (1792)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:z603vs03p/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This 1792 map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vs02d) was among the first printed plans of Washington, D.C., the new seat of the federal government. Its location on the Potomac River was determined as a result of the Compromise of 1790. Thomas Jefferson and his supporters agreed that the nation would take on state debts incurred during the Revolutionary War in exchange for the mid-Atlantic capital site selected by George Washington. Though Maryland surveyor Andrew Ellicott created this map, he based it on designs by French engineer Pierre L'Enfant. The map is illustrated in [Edward Savage’s portrait of the Washington family](https://www.nga.gov/artworks/561-washington-family).

#### Henry D. Pursell, *[A map of the United States of N. America](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vt312)* (1784)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:z603vt32b/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vt312), produced soon after the Treaty of Paris, depicts the United States with its new territories west of the Appalachian Mountains. Although Britain had cordoned off this land for Native Americans with the 1763 Proclamation Line, the United States planned to integrate this territory into the new nation. To create an “orderly and diplomatic process” with the indigenous people of the region, the Continental Congress imposed Thomas Jefferson’s Land Ordinance of 1784. This legislation regulated the governance of the territory, and divided the region into ten states, each with specified boundaries. Jefferson proposed ten names for the states, which are included on this map and outlined in light red.
