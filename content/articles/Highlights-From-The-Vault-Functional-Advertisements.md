> **On July 19, we hosted *From The Vault: Functional Advertisements***\
> \
> *From The Vault* is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. In this *From The Vault*, the spotlight was on maps as functional advertisements, which can be defined as a marketing strategy for companies or institutions to included a useful and functional item in their ads as an added benefit to draw in consumers. As you read along, consider how these maps act as historical artifacts and imagine what life was like for the average consumer of the early 20th century, the maps' target audience.

##### Don Bloodgood [Ask Shell! ](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6969z354f)(1948–1955)

This corporation decided to take a unique approach to incorporating maps into its ads. A map created for Shell—the oil company—is shown above. This map is one of the more modern in this collection, as we can see because of its use of automobiles. The company used this abstract land to sell its customers the idea of a perfect vacation. Instead of being rooted in a real location like other advertising maps, Shell leaned into the concept of needing personal transportation to reach such beautiful destinations.  

##### Pichon [Nouveau plan routier de la ville et faubourgs de Paris avec ses principaux édifices et nouvelles barrières](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:kh04p6588) (1802)

The French Revolution was an event that had worldwide impact and gave many the courage to fight back against oppressive ruling governments. Began in 1789 and ended in the late 1790s with the ascent of Napoleon Bonaparte, French citizens radically altered their political structure. The upheaval was caused by disgust with the French aristocracy and the economic policies of King Louis XVI who had left France incredibly economically unstable. Revolting against years of exploitation, peasants looted and burned the homes of tax collectors, landlords and the aristocratic elite.

This map was created post-war and highlights the important cultural features of the city and showcases the deliberate planning, organization, and expansion of Paris. Depicting the rebuilding of Paris after the French Revolution, you can see the expansion of the city past its old city walls symbolizing a healing and growing nation.

##### Samuel Swett [Sketch of Bunker Hill Battle](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3t947b90p) (1826)

This map depicts the Battle of Bunker Hill, known as the first major battle of the American Revolution. The battle took place in Charlestown, just outside of Boston, and was named after the tallest hill in the area, though the majority of the battle took place on Breed’s Hill, located near the center of the map. Lines of fire, British entry points, and a colonist fort are depicted on this map created 50 years after the initial battle.

##### Robert Sayer and John Bennett [The theatre of war in North America, with the roads and a table of the distances](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:z603vs95d) (1776)

A full and in-depth account of all of the British colonies and their populations in North America. Included with this detailed map are full descriptions of each region, including regional markers, prominent counties and the towns within them, all large lakes, rivers, capes, and bays. Also featured on the center-right of the map is a chart showing how the distance (in British miles) between prominent colonial cities were from each other. A map of this kind would have been incredibly helpful to orient the British military to the new American fight for independence.

##### Mondhare [Reddition de l'armée Angloises commandée par Mylord Comte de Cornwallis aux armees combinées des Etats Unis de l'Amerique et de France aux ordres des Generaux Washington et de Rochambeau a Yorck Touwn et Glocester dans la Virginie : le 19 Octobre 1781](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:dz010t968) (1781)

A unique Revolutionary-era map, this depicts a French perspective of the British surrender at Yorktown to the Americans. After six years of war, both the British and American armies were exhausted and ready for an end to the war. In 1781, Washington and his French ally, Lt. Gen. Comte de Rochambeau decided to attack Yorktown, Virginia where a large amount of British troops were stationed. Making the hundreds of miles trek in the largest troop movement of the war, the American and French forces were met with a French fleet and surprised the British troops with a siege. This was the last major land battle of the American Revolution and led to negotiations for peace with the British and the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783.

##### E.A. Aston [Carsonia the great betrayal! ](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:ht250551k)(1920)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:ht250552v/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

From the middle of the Irish independence war, this map focuses on the division of Ireland and makes a case for why the argument to splitting up Northern Ireland along religious lines wasn’t being correctly considered. Sir Edward Carson, a prominent political figure from Dublin, claimed that the proposed Northern counties were religiously homogeneous and Protestant (who supported Britain). 

While technically true, the religious divide was much closer to an equal 50/50 split of Protestants and Catholics (who supported a totally free Irish state). This caused many to call Carson a traitor and betrayer by using deceiving tactics to force the nationalist Catholics into a heavily policed and discriminatory North Ireland. The Republic of Ireland was formed in 1922 as a free state, while North Ireland remains a part of Britain to the present.

##### Charles Magnus & Co [Magnus' panoramic view map of India](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463283x) (1857)

Created in the midst of India’s first War of Independence (also known as the Sepoy Mutiny) this map indicates the “Leading Seats of Insurrection” against the British in a bright, nearly blood red color. Though unrest had long been stirring during the British occupation of India, it wasn’t until 1857 that the first fight for independence began.

The breaking point came when Indian soldiers, called sepoys, were given bullets by British officials that in order to be used required their casings to be bitten off. These bullets were greased with lard, believed by Indian troops to be either pig or cow fat. The use of cow fat goes against doctrines of Hinduism, while the use of pig fat opposes Islamic doctrine, the two major religions of India. The insult to both religions sparked rebellions by Indian sepoys against their British officers.
