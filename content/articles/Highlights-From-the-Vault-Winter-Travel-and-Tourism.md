For this edition of the series, we looked at objects from our collections that map winter attractions, climate, and methods of travel.

Along the Canadian Pacific Railway, the words ‘Coal Mine’, and ‘Anthracite’ depict an area that hosted a coal mine in the late 19th-early 20th century. The coal mine shut down and the town of Anthracite was eventually deserted; it is now known as a ghost town.
