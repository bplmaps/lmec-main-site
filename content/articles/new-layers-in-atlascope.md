In January 2023, when we released an updated version of [Atlascope](https://atlascope.org)---the Leventhal Center's digital tool for exploring historic urban atlases---we rolled out new features for creating [Atlascope Tours](https://www.atlascope.org/#/view:tour$tour:346059865907527756) and user-submitted annotations, as well as searching [Digital Commonwealth](https://digitalcommonwealth.org) by geographic area. We viewed this as the next step towards extending Atlascope into a tool that doesn't merely facilitate access to historic cartographic collections, but actually enables users to research, curate, and interpret their own stories.

In udpating Atlascope, however, there was a crucial little thing that we did not include: **more atlases**.

For nearly three years, Atlascope has boasted "101 atlas layers of Boston and its inner suburbs." While 101 is a great number, it represents only a fraction of the cities and towns that are represented in the Leventhal Center's vast [collection of urban atlases](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?per_page=100&q=urban+atlas).

Today, we're excited to announce that we've added **five new atlas layers across three towns to Atlascope: Dover, Hull, and Lynn**. We view urban atlases not only as excellent resources for learning concrete facts about historical geography---possibly no other resource provides the same level of granularity---but also jumping-off points for telling new stories about the world around us. Here is a small selection of what you can find in the latest Atlascope layers.

#### Dover: The prefab capital of the Commonwealth

{{< figure src="https://hne-rs.s3.amazonaws.com/filestore/4/2/5/4/0/6_38e5b7396d90f81/425406scr_e52bac57a63f1b2.jpg" caption="A page from a 1919 E.F. Hodgson catalog, from [Historic New England](https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/gusn/283772/)." class="figure-right" >}}

If you thought there isn't much to see in [this map of **Dover** from 1909](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-71.28028,42.24533$zoom:17.37$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/alj7lxnzb), you'd be mistaken. Excerpted from a [much larger atlas of towns in Norfolk County](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:jd475s50k), this single plate contains a fascinating story in the {{<popup img-src="/uploads/hodgson.png" target="blank">}}E.F. Hodgson factory.{{</popup>}}

Founded in 1892, Hodgson was one of the earliest creators of prefabricated housing in the United States. Hodgson houses were primarily advertised in catalogs, but they were also showcased in public exhibitions. The catalog to the right, for example, highlights a [1919 exhibition at the Mechanics Building in Boston](https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/gusn/283772/). Apparently, Hodgson Portable Houses were incredibly mobile; the [next page in the catalog](https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/gusn/283772/) features "a few of the Hodgson Portable Houses sent to Italy after the earthquake."

The turn of the twentieth century was a transformative time for sub/urban change in the United States. Technologies like prefabrication not only created new ways of accessing housing, but new ways of thinking about home. By 1933, the architect George Fred Keck materialized these ideas in his "[House of Tomorrow](https://www.indianalandmarks.org/about/house-of-tomorrow/)," a futuristic structure designed for the 1933 World's Fair that prompted attendees to consider the intersections between science, technology, and domestic life. Though it was perhaps less well-known than Keck's work, the Hodgson Houses were certainly no less significant.

Just north of the factory in Dover, a {{<popup img-src="/uploads/hodgson-home.png" target="blank">}}wooden structure is listed as owned by one E.F. Hodgson.{{</popup>}} Presumably the home of the company's eponymous founder, one has to wonder whether he lived in the very same products that came off his assembly line around the corner.

#### Hull: The heydays of Nantasket Beach

For our current exhibition, *Building Blocks*, Laura Lee Schmidt writes that Revere Beach constituted a "[landscape of marvels](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/topics/having-fun/)." In the early 20th century, amusement parks and fairgrounds could be commonly found at the end of streetcar lines---often placed there . Nearly twenty years earlier, however, the town of **Hull** boasted its own landscape of marvels in Nantasket Beach.

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:g158bn69r/full/pct:40/0/default.jpg" caption="Postcard for the Nantasket Hotel, from the [Boston Public Library Arts Department](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:g158bn68g)." class="figure-left" >}}

The [1895 Atlascope view of Hull](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.85802,42.27136$zoom:16.87$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/algwfrn83) reveals a town that has in some ways only just begun to expand. Sagamore Head has been {{<popup img-src="/uploads/sagamore.png" target="blank">}}subdivided but hardly developed,{{</popup>}} while {{<popup img-src="/uploads/allerton.png" target="blank">}}yellow buildings pockmark the coasts{{</popup>}} further north towards Allerton, indicating that construction is mostly limited to desirable waterfront properties. Just across from the Nantasket Steamboat Wharf, however, we find the [main drag of Nantasket Beach](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.85602,42.27099$zoom:17.64$base:massgis-2021-orthos$overlay:ark:/76611/algwfrn83) replete with fun and games, from {{<popup img-src="/uploads/merry.png" target="blank">}}shuffleboard, toboggans, and a merry go round{{</popup>}} to a {{<popup img-src="/uploads/hotel.png" target="blank">}}dance hall, maze, and "automatic swing."{{</popup>}}

The postcard above displays the rocky shores of Nantasket Beach sometime between 1930 and 1945, with then-famous Hotel Nantasket in the distance. To whatever extent Nantasket had been a hotbed for illicit activity in the late nineteenth century, as [some sources suggest](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Rosen-5/publication/266617193_QUATERNARY_ENVIRONMENTS_AND_HISTORY_OF_BOSTON_HARBOR_MASSACHUSETTS/links/5435a6130cf2643ab9867d8a/QUATERNARY-ENVIRONMENTS-AND-HISTORY-OF-BOSTON-HARBOR-MASSACHUSETTS.pdf), it seems to have decidedly redeemed itself as a family-friendly tourist destination by the turn of the twentieth.


#### Lynn: "Like Webster's dictionary, we're Morocco bound"

When we turn the clock back to 1880 in **Lynn**, we find a fairly recognizable landscape. [Downtown bustles](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.95366,42.46398$zoom:18.02$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/aliugq9xo) with many institutions that are still recognizable today, including City Hall, St. Stephen's Memorial Church, St. Mary's Church, and the Lynn Common. Making our way north up Franklin Street, however, we find something unfamiliar: a set of buildings nestled between Pine Grove Cemetery and an anonymous brook, bearing the curious label "[Morocco Factory](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.95812,42.47225$zoom:17.95$base:massgis-2021-orthos$overlay:ark:/76611/aliugq9xo)."

{{< figure src="/uploads/pevear.png" caption="Screenshot of George K. and Henry A. Pevear's morocco factory in Atlascope." class="figure-right" >}}

To modern ears, this phrase might not make much sense, but a late-19th century Bay Stater would have easily recognized it as a leather factory. Morocco leather, or simply "morocco" in most cases, is a kind of leather made from goatskin. Known for its pliability, softness, and distinctive colors, morocco was used commonly in wallets, luggage, and the uppers of shoes. Morocco manufacturers were common in New England, with known locations in [Acton](https://www.actonhistoricalsociety.org/blog/morocco-in-south-acton) and {{<popup img-src="/uploads/morocco-leather.jpeg" target="blank">}}Boston{{</popup>}} as well as Lynn. The leather itself was was popular enough---especially as a [material for bookbindings](https://www.baumanrarebooks.com/blog/the-secret-language-of-rare-books-morocco/)---that Bing Crosby and Bob Hope's 1942 song "(We're Off on the) Road to Morocco" includes the line, "like Webster's dictionary, we're Morocco bound."

An 1898 issue of [*The register of the Lynn historical society*](https://archive.org/details/registeroflynnhi08lynn/page/n199/mode/2up) notes that the business of "morocco dressing... had long gained a foothold on the brook." Indeed, just southwest of the factory owned by George A. and Henry K. Pevear, at the corner of Boston and Washington Streets, we can see a competing "[Morocco Works](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.95759,42.47162$zoom:18.87$base:massgis-2021-orthos$overlay:ark:/76611/aliugq9xo)" apparently owned by Shute & Faulkner. Eight years after this atlas was printed, that morocco works would catch fire in [what *The New York Times* called](https://www.nytimes.com/1888/12/23/archives/a-big-fire-in-lynn.html) "the most disastrous conflagration that has visited that city for a year." The owners appear to have [rebuilt the factory by 1905](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.95818,42.47133$zoom:18.87$base:massgis-2021-orthos$overlay:ark:/76611/aliyp2doa), the next year for which we have Atlascope coverage of Lynn. It is perhaps not surprising that in doing so, they incorporated brick---indicated by the pink shading---into the building's frame.
