For nearly three years, [Atlascope](https://atlascope.org)---the Leventhal Center's digital tool for exploring historic urban atlases---has boasted "101 atlas layers of Boston and its inner suburbs." While 101 is a great number, it represents only a fraction of the cities and towns that are represented in the Leventhal Center's vast [collection of urban atlases](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?per_page=100&q=urban+atlas).

When we released an improved version of Atlascope in January 2023, we included new features for creating [Atlascope Tours](https://www.atlascope.org/#/view:tour$tour:346059865907527756), capturing user-submitted annotations, and searching [Digital Commonwealth](https://digitalcommonwealth.org) by geographic area, it was the next step towards our vision of an Atlascope where . Today, we're excited to announce that we've added **five new atlas layers across three towns**.

#### The prefab capital of the Commonwealth

{{< figure src="https://hne-rs.s3.amazonaws.com/filestore/4/2/5/4/0/6_38e5b7396d90f81/425406scr_e52bac57a63f1b2.jpg" caption="A page from a 1919 E.F. Hodgson catalog, from [Historic New England](https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/gusn/283772/)." class="figure-right" >}}

You'd be mistaken to think that there isn't much to see in the map of **Dover** from 1909. Excerpted from a [much larger atlas of towns in Norfolk County](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:jd475s50k), this [single plate contains a fascinating story](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-71.28028,42.24533$zoom:17.37$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/alj7lxnzb) in the {{<popup img-src="/uploads/hodgson.png" target="blank">}}E.F. Hodgson factory.{{</popup>}} Founded in 1892, Hodgson was one of the earliest creators of prefabricated housing in the United States.

Hodgson houses were primarily advertised in catalogs, but they were also showcased in public exhibitions. The catalog to the right, for example, highlights a [1919 exhibition at the Mechanics Building in Boston](https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/gusn/283772/). Apparently, Hodgson Portable Houses were incredibly mobile; the [next page in the catalog](https://www.historicnewengland.org/explore/collections-access/gusn/283772/) features "a few of the Hodgson Portable Houses sent to Italy after the earthquake."

Just north of the factory in Dover, a {{<popup img-src="/uploads/hodgson-home.png" target="blank">}}wooden structure is listed as owned by one E.F. Hodgson.{{</popup>}} Presumably the home of the company's eponymous founder, one has to wonder whether he lived in the very same products that came off the assembly line around the corner.

#### The heydays of Nantasket Beach

For our current exhibition, *Building Blocks*, Laura Lee Schmidt writes that Revere Beach constituted a "[landscape of marvels](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/topics/having-fun/)" in 1914. Nearly twenty years earlier, however, the town of **Hull** boasted its own landscape of marvels in Nantasket Beach.

The [1895 Atlascope view of Hull](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.85802,42.27136$zoom:16.87$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/algwfrn83) reveals a town that has in some ways only just begun to expand. Sagamore Head has been {{<popup img-src="/uploads/sagamore.png" target="blank">}}subdivided but hardly developed{{</popup>}}, while {{<popup img-src="/uploads/allerton.png" target="blank">}}yellow buildings pockmark the coasts{{</popup>}} further north towards Allerton, indicating that construction. Just across from the Nantasket Steamboat Wharf, however, we find the [main drag of Nantasket Beach](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.85602,42.27099$zoom:17.64$base:massgis-2021-orthos$overlay:ark:/76611/algwfrn83) replete with fun and games, from {{<popup img-src="/uploads/merry.png" target="blank">}}shuffleboard, toboggans, and a merry go round{{</popup>}} to a {{<popup img-src="/uploads/hotel.png" target="blank">}}dance hall, maze, and "automatic swing."{{</popup>}}

The postcard below displays the rocky shores of Nantasket Beach sometime between 1930 and 1945, with then-famous Hotel Nantasket in the distance. To whatever extent Nantasket had been a hotbed for illicit activity in the late nineteenth century, as [some sources suggest](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Rosen-5/publication/266617193_QUATERNARY_ENVIRONMENTS_AND_HISTORY_OF_BOSTON_HARBOR_MASSACHUSETTS/links/5435a6130cf2643ab9867d8a/QUATERNARY-ENVIRONMENTS-AND-HISTORY-OF-BOSTON-HARBOR-MASSACHUSETTS.pdf), it seems to have decidedly redeemed itself as a family-friendly tourist destination by the turn of the 20th century.

#### "Like Webster's dictionary, we're Morocco bound"

When we turn the clock back to 1880 in **Lynn**, we find a fairly recognizable landscape. [Downtown bustles](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.95366,42.46398$zoom:18.02$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/aliugq9xo) with many institutions that are still recognizable today, including City Hall, St. Stephen's Memorial Church, St. Mary's Church, and the Lynn Common. Making our way north up Franklin Street, however, we find something unfamiliar: a set of buildings nestled between Pine Grove Cemetery and an anonymous brook, bearing the curious label "[Morocco Factory](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.95812,42.47225$zoom:17.95$base:massgis-2021-orthos$overlay:ark:/76611/aliugq9xo)."

{{< figure src="/uploads/pevear.png" caption="Screenshot of George K. and Henry A. Pevear's morocco factory in Atlascope." class="figure-left" >}}

To modern ears, this phrase might not make much sense, but a late-19th century Bay Stater would have easily recognized it as a leather factory. Morocco leather, or simply "morocco" in most cases, is a kind of leather made from goatskin. Known for its pliability, softness, and distinctive colors, morocco was used commonly in wallets, luggage, and the uppers of shoes. Morocco manufacturers were common in New England, with known locations in [Acton](https://www.actonhistoricalsociety.org/blog/morocco-in-south-acton) and {{<popup img-src="/uploads/morocco-leather.jpeg" target="blank">}}Boston{{</popup>}} as well as Lynn. The leather itself was was popular enough---especially as a [material for bookbindings](https://www.baumanrarebooks.com/blog/the-secret-language-of-rare-books-morocco/)---that Bing Crosby and Bob Hope's 1942 song "(We're Off on the) Road to Morocco" includes the line, "like Webster's dictionary, we're Morocco bound."

An 1898 issue of [The register of the Lynn historical society](https://archive.org/details/registeroflynnhi08lynn/page/n199/mode/2up) notes that the business of "morocco dressing... had long gained a foothold on the brook." Indeed, just southwest of the factory owned by George A. and Henry K. Pevear, at the corner of Boston and Washington Streets, we can see a competing "[Morocco Works](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.95759,42.47162$zoom:18.87$base:massgis-2021-orthos$overlay:ark:/76611/aliugq9xo)" apparently owned by Shute & Faulkner. Eight years after this atlas was printed, that morocco works would catch fire in [what *The New York Times* called](https://www.nytimes.com/1888/12/23/archives/a-big-fire-in-lynn.html) "the most disastrous conflagration that has visited that city for a year." The owners appear to have [rebuilt the factory by 1905](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-70.95818,42.47133$zoom:18.87$base:massgis-2021-orthos$overlay:ark:/76611/aliyp2doa), the next year for which we have Atlascope coverage of Lynn. It is perhaps not surprising that in doing so, they incorporated brick---indicated by the pink shading---into the building's frame.

Although the brook and both its factories have been replaced with a parking lot, that doesn't mean the memory of morocco has been erased entirely from the landscape. One of the establishments served by the parking lot, funnily enough, is a Pennyworth's.
