### At the end of the Cape


{{< figure src="/uploads/pogy-boats.jpg" caption="Pogy boats." class="figure-right">}}

At the very end of the Cape lies a town that means something a little different to many different individuals. For many, it’s long been [haven for the LGBTQ+ community](https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/how-ptown-got-so-gay-gay-gay/). Some may know it for its [decades-old art scene](https://ptownie.com/2022-provincetown-art-magazine/), and  for its history, heavily informed by its geographic situation at the edge of the continent. Whoever you are, nobody can deny that Provincetown (P-town) is rich with hundreds of various stories. 

Both the Wampanoag and Nauset peoples lived on the land that would become Provincetown at least six-hundred years before the arrival of the Mayflower. Ptown was the landing point for the boat in 1620, where they stayed for around a month, incited a "skirmish"[^1] with the Pamet peoples, signed the Mayflower Compact, and moved onto Plymouth.

Ptown began to mature during the 19th century, with the advent of the [whaling industry](https://ptownie.com/history/provincetown-history-early-whalers/); its position, with easy access to the Massachusetts Bay and the Atlantic, made it the perfect place for the whaling and fishing business to set up shop. John F. Murphy's map of steambout routes in Boston Harbor, for example, depicts Provincetown as a distant but present mark within Boston's rapidly growing urban system at the turn of the 20th century.

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9k41zj58k/full/pct:20/0/default.jpg" caption="John F. Walker's [*Bird's Eye View of Boston Harbor and South Shore to Provincetown*](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3760753)." class="figure-center">}}

Towards the end of the 1800s, the whaling industry had fallen into a steady decline, but not before attracting numerous Portuguese immigrants to the area. Mostly fishermen, they hailed from from the Azores and grew to dominate the fishing industry in the town, over time bringing their families as well as the Catholic Church to P-town. To this day, the town retains a prominent Portuguese community, celebrated in the annual festival and present throughout the town’s restaurants and bakeries.

### Header about urban atlases

When Charles Hawthorne opened the Cape Cod School of Art in the town in 1899, the town's story as an artist’s haven opened. Artists of all kinds were attracted to the towns character, and by the onset of World War I, many writers, artists and playwrights alike called the town home, enjoying the town's freedom and acceptance. It was that same spirit that, by the 1960s, had started to make the town a haven for the LGBTQ+ community, including during the AIDS crisis, which Jeanne Braham and Pamela Peterson describe in their book.

The town remains a welcoming, safe haven for many who call it an annual vacation spot and many more who call it home. Take a look back at how Provincetown’s famous downtown area has looked and changed in years gone by.
