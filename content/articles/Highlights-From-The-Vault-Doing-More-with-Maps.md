> *On November 22, we hosted **From The Vault: Doing More with maps***.

For this collections showing, we welcomed educators attending the National Council for Social Studies Conference alongside general visitors and shared maps that encouraged us to think about how who made or paid for the creation of each map impacts what is depicted (or excluded).

## Who Made the Map?

#### John Bonner, [The town of Boston in New England](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f943z) (1835)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633f9447/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

We often use this 1722 map of Boston with visiting students. We love to ask the question: **What does the person who made the map want us to pay attention to?**

John Bonner (c.1643-1726) lived in Boston with his wife, Mary, and his son, John. He was a captain, navigator, and shipwright (shipbuilder). It comes as no surprise then—and students often notice—Bonner highlights Boston’s role as a port city. He not only includes the details of all of the wharves, docks, and shipyards—he also takes the energy to detail several ships in the harbor.

This is the first printed map of Boston and gives us a significant understanding of what was here in the early eighteenth century.

#### &#xA;Louise E. Jefferson, [Uprooted people of the U.S.A.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:t722kt12g) (1945)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:8p58rx80k/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

With a map like this, we ask students: How does the cartographer capture our attention?

At first glance, this map may look like a typical twentieth-century tourist map of the United States. The color palette of primary colors, inclusion of numerous figures across the map and the decorative border all echo the maps sold to travelers to promote positive views of the United States.

This map was created by Louise E. Jefferson, an African American woman who achieved success in many fields. In this map, Jefferson highlights the impact of war on where and how Americans live. She points in her caption in the lower left corner that 25,000,000 Americans have been physically uprooted since 1940. Across the country she includes factors included Japanese internment camps, multiple negro migrations, and military training facilities. Jefferson demonstrates the complicated landscape of war from victory gardens to prisoner of war camps.

#### Don Bloodgood, [Ask Shell!](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:6969z354f) \[1948–1955]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:fn107c46z/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This map rewards the viewer with a feast of activity. With so much going on, we start by asking students: What do you notice first?

As we absorb the scene, we see all sorts of high jinks as campers wrestle with tents, fishermen are caught by their own hooks, cows eat paintings, and row boats tip over their passengers. Broken down cars are scattered across the roads.

We realize this map isn't really a map at all, at least not one of a real place. Instead, it's an imaginary mashup of the American West, the iconic landscape for the family road trips which became a rite of passage for many Americans in the postwar years, when this was published. A mutually reinforcing relationship between map publishers, oil and gas companies, automobile manufacturers, and tourist boards during this period made the road map one of the most recognizable forms of popular cartography.

## How Do Maps Shape Us?

#### Republican National Committee, [Electoral votes for President in 1916 and for Congress in 1918 : make your guess for 1920](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fq53w) \[1919?]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fq545/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

We have become accustomed to making assumptions about “red” and “blue” states. However, the colors have not always had the same assumptions of political allegiance.

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fq53w) uses blue and red for elections in a different way than we are used to in 2024.

We ask students, “What patterns and trends do you see?”

#### [Nathan Braccio](https://nathanbraccio.com/), ***Praying Towns Relative to English Borders, Algonquian Country, and Major Algonquian Path***

{{< figure src="https://nathanbraccio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Full-map.png" >}}

“Praying Towns” were created in the 17th century to christianize and forcibly assimilate Native Americans in Massachusetts. As Puritan authority over the region grew, so did the number of praying towns. Additionally, these towns were deliberately placed along major Algonquian paths that were highly frequented by the Indigenous people of the area, almost guaranteeing interaction with the Puritans determined to convert them.

#### James Mooney, ***[Map showing distribution of indian stocks and tribes, between 1710-1720](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149w677)*** (1904)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149w68h/full/,1400/0/default.jpg" >}}

This 1904 map is depicting the perceived historic ancestry/Tribes of Indigenous people across the United States - think of how this map compares to some of the more modern, Indigenous-created maps also on display. Currently, all Federally Recognized Nations are managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which sits under the umbrella of the Department of Interior. The present Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, is the first American Indian to lead this department since its founding in 1849.

##### U.S. Department of the Interior Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, ***[Federal Indian Boarding School Sites](https://www.bia.gov/sites/default/files/dup/inline-files/appendix_c_school_maps_508.pdf)*** (2022)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/Indian boarding schools.png" class="" >}}

In June 2021, Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, announced the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative, a comprehensive effort to recognize the troubled legacy of federal Indian boarding school policies. In these boarding schools, Indian children were forcibly abducted by government agents, sent to schools hundreds of miles away from their families and homes, and beaten, starved, or otherwise abused when they spoke their Native languages. The goal of the modern initiative is to address the schools’ long-standing intergenerational impact and to shed light on the traumas committed in the past. For a time, some Native children from Massachusetts were sent to one of these boarding schools, the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania.

##### United States. Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, ***[Map of the Indian Territory : showing the progress and status of townsite appraisements, under the supervision of the United States Indian Inspector for the Indian Territory, June 30, 1902](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:qj72rw92q)*** (1903)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:v979xs00v/full/,1400/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

In 1900, the Cherokee tribe of Indians in Indian Territory had their lands appraised for their market value, with some exceptions, as a part of the negotiations for the cession of lands. This was due to the passing of the General Allotment Act, or Dawes Act, in 1887, some 15 years earlier, that aimed to divided designated reservation land into parcels, with the goal of breaking down tribal relationships and assimilating Native Americans into mainstream society by breaking up communal, reservation land into individually owned plots of land. Before the Dawes was repealed in 1934, the US government, in addition to land swindlers, had commandeered about 90 million acres from Native Americans, or close to two-thirds of their land.
