\# Jamaica Plain By Map

For the last several months, we've been cohosting neighborhood community history nights with BPL branch libraries! Last night, we had a lot of fun exploring Jamaica Plain. It gave us a chance to show off our wonderful \[Atlascope\](atlascope.leventhalmap.org) tool, interact with patrons, and take a dive into some local history!

We started a little further north than JP, at the mouth of the Muddy River. While it's called a river, it is actually a series of brooks and ponds running into the Charles. You can see in the view below what it looked like in 1873 before Back Bay was filled.
