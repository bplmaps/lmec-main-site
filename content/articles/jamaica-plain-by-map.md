# Jamaica Plain By Map

For the last several months, we've been cohosting neighborhood community history nights with BPL branch libraries! Last night, we had a lot of fun exploring Jamaica Plain. It gave us a chance to show off our wonderful [Atlascope](atlascope.leventhalmap.org) tool, interact with patrons, and take a dive into some local history!

We started a little further north than JP, at the mouth of the Muddy River. While it's called a river, it is actually a series of brooks and ponds running into the Charles. You can see in the view below what it looked like in 1873 before Back Bay was filled.

Between 1880 and 1900, the Emerald Necklace was created. In the process, the Muddy River was banked and controlled, in part of the effort to "reclaim" (or perhaps more appropriately, to claim) the marshy landscape.

In this view, we can see where Stony Brook used to feed into the Muddy River, and how the stream seems to disappear between 1873 and 1931. In the 1931 view, though, we can see that the property lines continued to follow the topography constructed by the stream.

Here's a photograph of the above neighborhood from [Historic New England](https://www.historicnewengland.org/). This is reportedly the worst flooding that Roxbury ever experienced from Stony Brook, in February of 1886. There was as much as three feet of water in some places along Ruggles St.

Stony Brook was culverted over the century between the 1850's and 1950's, slowly but surely burying the whole thing underground. This photograph from the [BPL collections](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search?f%5Bphysical_location_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Boston+Public+Library) shows one of the conduits into which the river was diverted.

Jamaica Pond, on the other hand, is the same shape it has been for a long time! You can see here the difference between 1890 and 1914, which mostly consists of the removal of buildings from around the pond and the creation of parkland.

A couple of these buildings at the edge of the pond are ice houses. Above is a photo of ice harvesters hacking away at the frozen surface at around the turn of the century.

One common theme in 19th to early 20th century urbanization is the breaking up of large properties. Here, you can swipe to see the change over 40 years as large landowners become less common and land is divided into smaller parcels and built on. On the right side you can also pan to see more of Franklin Park, which was established as West Roxbury Park in the 1880's.

Jamaica Plain has also been home to manufacturing over the years, including the Thomas G. Plant Company which produced boots and shoes, and the Moxie factory which was a soda company.

Another major product of the neighborhood was beer. Brewing companies made use of the Stony Brook to power their factories. This Boylston Bock label is an example of a beer brewed in Jamaica Plain, and given a local name!

<iframe width="700" height="550" src="https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/#view:embed$base:001$overlay:39999059011013$zoom:20.00$center:-7915436.747289696,5208669.482803653$mode:glass$pos:487"></iframe>

Also making use of this name was the Boylston Schulverein, a German club on Danforth Street. Breweries are a signal of a German immigrant presence in the neighborhood, but this particular building as well as the names on the properties around it is another.


Names on properties can be misleading, though, or simply not provide us with as much information as we'd like. Only the names of property owners are listed rather than the names of the actual inhabitants of the house. Therefore, we don't get the full picture of the population of a neighborhood from these atlases alone.

<iframe width="700" height="550" src="https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/#view:embed$base:001$overlay:39999059011872$zoom:20.00$center:-7915687.556214813,5209159.224172146$mode:glass$pos:487"></iframe>

Another example of information hidden from these maps is in this 1915 view. L.G. Cuney at 43 Sheridan St. was probably Lloyd Garrison Cuney, brother of famous African-American musician and musicologist Maud Cuney-Hare. In all likelihood, Maud was the one who actually had the money to purchase this house, yet it is listed in her male relative's name. In 1919, Cuney-Hare with William Howard Richardson gave a concert and lecture at the BPL which was the first presentation by musicians of color in the series.

Above is an example of Cuney-Hare's correspondance with W.E.B. DuBois, which lists her address on Sheridan St. Many of DuBois's letters are available on [Digital Commonwealth](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/).

Our own collections house plenty of maps of Boston outside of the urban atlases we have! This bird's eye view map of Jamaica Plain is a particularly lovely one with illustrations of buildings of the neighborhood bordering the view itself.
