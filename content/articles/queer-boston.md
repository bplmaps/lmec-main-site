> This article was written by [Zoe Colimon](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/zoe-colimon/). Zoe is a student at the Boston Latin School and is spending the summer as a Seevak Fellow at the Leventhal Center working on public projects related to maps and social justice, and georeferencing atlases for [Atlascope](https://www.atlascope.org/). Alongside her drive to explore Boston’s history through a queer, racial, and artistic lens, Zoe incorporates her love of astrophysics and computer science into her work by combining critical thinking with technological skills.

On May 17, 2004, a historic turning point unfolded when the case Goodridge v. Dept of Public Health made Massachusetts the first state in the US to legalize same-sex marriage. This 4-3 ruling preceded a series of judicial efforts working to develop and support the LGBTQ+ community nationally. It is critical to acknowledge that this was only 20 years ago, and same-sex marriage was legalized nationally only 8 years ago. Boston specifically has a rich history of LGBTQ+ life and resilience that has led to the diverse queer network that the city holds today. Although current-day Boston appears extremely welcoming, it's important to recognize that this liberation was gained through the tireless efforts of the LGBTQ+ community fighting for their rights and visibility. Exploring the timeline of this tenacious community is vital to understanding what they have endured, and how a true sense of community can facilitate progress against all odds.

Through a network of safe spaces, the LGBTQ+ community of twentieth-century Boston forged connections and navigated adversity together. Starting with speakeasies in the 20s and 30s, such as Crawford House at {{<popup img-src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/crawfordhouse.png" target="blank">}} 83 Court St.{{</popup>}} and [Playland Cafe](https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/06/29/boston-lost-lgbtq-spaces-playland-georden-west) at 21 Essex St. in downtown Boston, they expanded their networks.

The 50s served as a transformative decade. With the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling in favor of the existing sodomy laws in 1954 and 1959, reform surrounding ideas of same sex relations appeared bleak. Furthermore, the intensification of the Red Scare during the 40s and early 50s paved the way for the “[Lavender Scare](https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2016/summer/lavender.html)” policy. The Lavender Scare was put into effect under the notion that the queer community “posed a threat to national security because they were vulnerable to blackmail and were considered to have weak moral characters,” says historian David K. Johnson. Via this policy, every government employee was subject to an unlawful security investigation without the presence of an attorney. Many were asked invasive and intimate questions about their private sexual lives.

Nevertheless, queer Boston continued to create safe spaces through a diverse network of bars. In the 1950s, [Park Square](https://markthomaskrone.wordpress.com/tag/the-punch-bowl/) and Bay Village in downtown were essential to the development of queer Boston through its clubs such as The [Punch Bowl](https://mangozeen.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-punch-bowl-boston.html) at 12 Carver St., Jacques at 79 Broadway St., the [Napoleon Club](https://www.historyproject.org/sites/default/files/images_nonwebsite/stonewall50/napoleons-sign.jpg) at 52 Piedmont St., and Mario’s at 69 Church St., which were all within a few blocks of each other. Established in 1929, the {{<popup img-src="https://www.historyproject.org/sites/default/files/images_nonwebsite/stonewall50/napoleons-sign.jpg" target="blank">}} Napoleon Club{{</popup>}} hosted an ever present nightlife for the queer community, becoming exclusively gay in 1952. It was even visited weekly by the legendary Judy Garland before her suicide. {{<popup img-src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/punchbowl.jpeg" target="blank">}} The Punchbowl{{</popup>}} expected a line out the door of several hundred on the daily, and it was usually populated by individuals ranging from students to drag queens. Nestled in the landscape of hysteria and bigotry, these safe havens were simultaneously subject to police raids. A witness of one of these tense moments recalls that “They used to flash the lights in the bar when the police came in. You had to switch partners (on the dance floor) in one second, woman to man. It was always touch and go about the cops coming in and raiding the place.” Aside from the distressing nature of these raids, older members of the community agree that these bars supported them by giving them a space to embrace their true identity.
