> This article was written by [Zoe Colimon](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/zoe-colimon/). Zoe is a student at the Boston Latin School and is spending the summer as a Seevak Fellow at the Leventhal Center working on public projects related to maps and social justice, and georeferencing atlases for [Atlascope](https://www.atlascope.org/). Alongside her drive to explore Boston’s history through a queer, racial, and artistic lens, Zoe incorporates her love of astrophysics and computer science into her work by combining critical thinking with technological skills.

On May 17th, 2004, a historic turning point unfolded when the case Goodridge v. Dept of Public Health made Massachusetts the first state in the US to legalize same-sex marriage. This 4-3 ruling preceded a series of judicial efforts working to develop and support the LGBTQ+ community nationally. It is critical to acknowledge that this was only 20 years ago, and same-sex marriage was legalized nationally only 8 years ago. Boston specifically has a rich history of LGBTQ+ life and resilience that has led to the diverse queer network that the city holds today. Although current-day Boston appears extremely welcoming, it's important to recognize that this liberation was gained through the tireless efforts of the LGBTQ+ community fighting for their rights and visibility. Exploring the timeline of this tenacious community is vital to understanding what they have endured, and how a true sense of community can facilitate progress against all odds.
