For our new rotating exhibition, [_Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/), the Map Center hired three high school students from Boston Public Schools as teen curators. We asked them to choose a place in the city and explore that site’s history going back to the nineteenth century, using our [urban atlas collection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=urban+atlas&search_field=all_fields) to kick off their research. We wanted them to consider how things change and how the present came to be the way it is today.

Close to my home in Brighton, there’s an old-looking {{< popup src="/uploads/2023-01-20/mansion.png"  target="blank" >}} mansion{{</popup>}}  [off Academy Hill Road](https://goo.gl/maps/cTtDXGoPLhK9bfHs6). I have wondered how the house is still standing, and why it looks the way it does. By searching for the house on [Atlascope](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-71.15437,42.34713$zoom:18.67$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/al88zw3ur), I learned that James Ambrose Hathaway owned the {{< popup src="/uploads/2023-01-24/hathaway.jpeg"  target="blank" >}} property{{</popup>}}  and it is known as the Hathaway Mansion.

[Hathaway](https://archives.lib.state.ma.us/handle/2452/204154) settled in Brighton around 1859 and made his fortune by exporting cattle to Great Britain. In fact, down the street from the Hathaway Mansion [is](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-71.15336,42.34988$zoom:17.50$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/al88zw3ur) {{< popup src="/uploads/2023-01-24/marketstreet.jpeg"  target="blank" >}} Market Street,{{</popup>}}  where cattle were brought into Brighton by the trainload on the Boston and Albany Railroad. 

By the 1820s, between 2,000 and 8,000 heads of cattle were delivered to the [Brighton Cattle Market](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:0c4862940) each week. On Thursday mornings, hundreds of farmers and merchants parked their vehicles in front of the {{< popup src="/uploads/2023-01-24/cattlefair.jpeg"  target="blank" >}} Cattle Fair Hotel,{{</popup>}}  eager to buy sheep and cattle. 

Butchering and selling cattle was economically profitable and influenced Brighton’s growth, transforming Brighton over time from a simple agricultural village into a prosperous “animal suburb.”
