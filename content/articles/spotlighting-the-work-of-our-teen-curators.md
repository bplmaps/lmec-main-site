For our new rotating exhibition, [_Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/), the Map Center hired three high school students from Boston Public Schools as teen curators. We asked them to choose a place in the city and explore that site’s history going back to the nineteenth century, using our [urban atlas collection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=urban+atlas&search_field=all_fields) to kick off their research. We wanted them to consider how things change and how the present came to be the way it is today.

Over the course of eight weeks, the students chose their locations and dug into their research using maps, historical documents, local histories, interviews with scholars, and trips to the sites to photograph and observe. They wrote up their findings, selected images to accompany their words, and gave video presentations on their process and what they learned, which you can watch down below. We hope that what you learn raises ideas and questions about our contemporary world and inspires you to research places that are important to your own life.

**Starting Point: A Curious Mansion**

Close to my home in Brighton, there’s an old-looking mansion on Academy Hill Road. I have wondered how the house is still standing, and why it looks the way it does. By [searching for the house on Atlascope](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-71.15433,42.34701$zoom:19.00$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/al88zw3ur), I learned that James Ambrose Hathaway owned the property and that it is known as the Hathaway Mansion.

**Discoveries: An Animal Suburb**

[James Ambrose](https://archives.lib.state.ma.us/handle/2452/204154) {{< popup src="/uploads/2023-01-19/ocm33284813_1888housealbumpage0019.jpeg"  target="blank" >}} Hathaway{{</popup>}}  settled in Brighton around 1859 and made his fortune by exporting cattle to Great Britain. In fact, down the street from the Hathaway Mansion is Market Street, where cattle were brought into Brighton by the trainload on the Boston and Albany Railroad. To the east of Market Street were the stockyards and to the west was the Abattoir, a site where cattle were processed and slaughtered. 

The Brighton stockyards were built in the late 1700s to help supply the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. Butchering and selling cattle became economically profitable and influenced Brighton’s growth. The cattle business transformed Brighton from a simple agricultural village into a prosperous “animal suburb.” By the 1820s, between two- and eight thousand heads of cattle were delivered each week to the Brighton Cattle Market.

Every Thursday at ten in the morning, hundreds of merchants and farmers parked their vehicles in front of the Cattle Fair Hotel, eager to buy sheep and cattle. Farmers throughout the US and Canada knew about the Brighton Cattle Market, which sold hundreds of thousands of cattle each year for over two million dollars in sales.

**Interpretations: Our Relation to Animals and Food**

It’s amazing how an old mansion led me to learning about a thriving cattle sector in historic Brighton. The fact that stockyards and cattle helped Brighton grow into a prosperous “animal suburb” is an important but little-known detail about Brighton. It impacted local families and individuals and influenced the town’s political and economic affairs. And it attracted a lot of tourists, commerce, and animals via railroads. This stands in contrast to modern Brighton, where urbanization and technological progress have distanced us from the realities of how the steak some may enjoy even got there.

Just as Brighton’s past connection to the bustling cattle market is now often forgotten, so do we no longer have the close relationship with animals that we once did, or care how cattle are mechanically slaughtered and processed. Today, although we have more safety regulations that keep the slaughter factories in order, meat processing is kept behind closed doors, out of sight from the public. Could the story of Brighton’s stockyards help current and future generations care about how animals become food?
