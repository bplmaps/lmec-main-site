For our new rotating exhibition, [_Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/), the Map Center hired three high school students from Boston Public Schools as teen curators. We asked them to choose a place in the city and explore that site’s history going back to the nineteenth century, using our urban atlas collection to kick off their research. We wanted them to consider how things change and how the present came to be the way it is today.

Over the course of eight weeks, the students chose their locations and dug into their research using maps, historical documents, local histories, interviews with scholars, and trips to the sites to photograph and observe. They wrote up their findings, selected images to accompany their words, and gave video presentations on their process and what they learned, which you can watch down below. We hope that what you learn raises ideas and questions about our contemporary world and inspires you to research places that are important to your own life.

### Maleeha Wasim: Hathaway Mansion

_Senior at the John D. O’Bryant High School in Roxbury_

#### Starting Point: A Curious Mansion

Close to my home in Brighton, there’s an old-looking mansion on Academy Hill Road. I have wondered how the house is still standing, and why it looks the way it does. My initial assumption was that this house might be haunted, but since occasionally I would see vehicles entering and leaving, I decided that probably wasn’t the case.

By searching for the house on Atlascope, I learned that James Ambrose Hathaway owned the property and that it is known as the Hathaway Mansion. My interest was piqued—who could afford such a large estate?

What happened to him? I did more research on Hathaway and discovered that he was not just involved in real estate, but also in the state legislature, and most curiously, in the cattle business.

#### Discoveries: An Animal Suburb

James Ambrose Hathaway settled in Brighton around 1859 and stayed there the rest of his life. He made his fortune by exporting cattle to Great Britain. In fact, down the street from the Hathaway Mansion is Market Street, where cattle were brought into Brighton by the trainload on the Boston and Albany Railroad, which crossed Market St.

The stockyards were to the east of Market Street and the Abattoir, a site where cattle were processed and slaughtered, was to the west. Who would have imagined that not so long ago, Brighton, once known as Little Cambridge, was surrounded by stockyards?

The Brighton stockyards were built in the late 1700s to help supply the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. Butchering and selling cattle became economically profitable and influenced Brighton’s growth. The cattle business transformed Brighton from a simple agricultural village into a prosperous “animal suburb.” By the 1820s, between two- and eight thousand heads of cattle were delivered each week to the Brighton Cattle Market.

Every Thursday at ten in the morning, hundreds of merchants and farmers parked their vehicles in front of the Cattle Fair Hotel, eager to buy sheep and cattle. Farmers throughout the US and Canada knew about the Brighton Cattle Market, which sold hundreds of thousands of cattle each year for over two million dollars in sales.

#### Interpretations: Our Relation to Animals and Food

It’s amazing how an old mansion led me to learning about a thriving cattle sector in historic Brighton. The fact that stockyards and cattle helped Brighton grow into a prosperous “animal suburb” is an important but little-known detail about Brighton. It impacted local families and individuals and influenced the town’s political and economic affairs. And it attracted a lot of tourists, commerce, and animals via railroads. This stands in contrast to modern Brighton, where urbanization and technological progress have distanced us from the realities of how the steak some may enjoy even got there.

Just as Brighton’s past connection to the bustling cattle market is now often forgotten, so do we no longer have the close relationship with animals that we once did, or care how cattle are mechanically slaughtered and processed. Today, although we have more safety regulations that keep the slaughter factories in order, meat processing is kept behind closed doors, out of sight from the public. Could the story of Brighton’s stockyards help current and future generations care about how animals become food?

### Nadia Madaoui: Kelleher Rose Garden

_Senior at the John D. O’Bryant High School in Roxbury_

#### Starting Points: Growing Up on the Fenway 

I was born in Boston and I lived across from the Museum of Fine Arts for the first half of my life. Being the child of two very different immigrant parents, they pushed me to be active so that I could gain experience. During the warmer months of the year, my father or mother would take me and my brother to various spots around Fenway to pass time, whether that be flying little toy drones in an empty basketball court or riding bikes on a track. Most of these areas were in the Emerald Necklace, a series of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted in the 1870s. When thinking about where I wanted to focus my research, one spot that came to me in particular was the Fenway Rose Garden

This garden has sentimental value to me because it reminds me of a time when things were far more simple than now. It reminds me of what peace is.

#### Discoveries: Peace During War

Built in 1931 and expanded in 1933, the James P. Kelleher Rose Garden is a site where visitors can come and rest and admire the many roses. Well after land reclamation of Back Bay was complete in the late nineteenth century, Mayor of Boston James M. Curley implemented a plan to smooth the slopes in front of the Museum of Fine Arts and create a garden that would lighten the space. The Rose Garden was and continues to be a place of peace for all those who seek it.

Memorials to Boston soldiers, those lost in the Korean, Vietnam and Second World Wars, are placed near to the Rose Garden. The largest, most decorated one of all commemorates those who lost their lives in World War II. In front of it: a woman with wings spread wide holding a sword and a bundle of branches. I see this statue as guarding the honor of those who died or bringing peace to war. The memorials speak of war not only in terms of victory but of loss. Even inside of the Rose Garden wartime echoes. Along the gravel path, you find small signs with the names of the roses that grow there, many reminiscent of war or patriotism (Mr. Lincoln, Fourth of July, Veteran’s Honor).

#### Interpretations

Just as Desconsol is in mournful isolation, so are we. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made more than 10 million people flee in refuge. And the war has affected all of us, from the economy to social relations. On top of that, we are still recovering from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The stress of this time in history has greatly affected students in high school. We too need places to rest. The Kelleher Rose Garden has lived through times of war and tension. People have found peace here, and you may too.

### Anh Do: Ronan Park

_Graduate of the Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, current freshman at Northeastern University_

#### Starting Points: A Hill to Relax the Mind

Ronan Park in Dorchester is a place where people come to relax, get some fresh air and exercise. I often hang out there with my friend in our free time. We usually sit on top of the hill and look out at the beach or watch the trains and people that jog by. The park is one of my top choices to relax my mind. A lot of trees surround the park and walkways. I frequently sit under one of them and gaze out at the views.

When I looked at the maps of the area from the 1800s, I noticed that it wasn’t always a park, and there were multiple land owners that had the same last name, “Pierce.” I wanted to learn why some of the Pierces didn’t build much on their lands.

#### Discoveries: Locating Mary Emery

The story of the Pierce family starts with John F. Pierce, who built two houses between 1818 and 1831 along the southeast slope of Mount Ida, the same hill on Adams Street that shapes Ronan Park. John married Catherine and had a son named Charles Bates Pierce. Charles married Mary Lyman Emery in 1846. Charles and Mary had two children, Elizabeth (b. 1847) and Charles Jr. (b. 1851). According to the 1855 Census, there were four Irish workers living with them.

In 1857, Charles Sr. died of typhoid, and he didn’t leave a will. Mary sold Charles’s properties. She was described in the 1860 Census as head of household with $7,000 in property and real estate, with one of her Irish workers, Kate Fitzgerald, listed as servant. But while Mary was in charge of selling her husband’s property, she couldn’t access the proceeds from the estate. She had to petition for an allowance from the estate and was awarded only $355. She and her children ended up living in a boarding house south of Fields Corner with twenty other people, including single women and families.

When Mary’s father-in-law John F. Pierce died in 1871, his estate was split between various family members, including Mary’s son Charles Jr. and her daughter Elizabeth. Eventually, Mary managed to purchase the 151 Adams St. property from her son and other heirs.It’s strange that Mary had to buy the lands from her own children and relatives. While she was struggling, Mary’s father-in-law, her husband’s relatives and her brother were all living well in the area. Her own family members ignored Mary during hard times. But she found a way to get her worth back.

The expansion of the Boston and Albany Railroad allowed the cattle industry to advance significantly by the time Hathaway arrived. The slaughterhouses and Abattoir, built in 1870, became a profitable industry for many property owners who were involved in the cattle business. Profits from the cattle trade also advanced real estate markets.

In Mr. Hathaway’s time of the late 1800s, Brighton was seen as the “wild west” of Boston. Crowded with stockyards and slaughterhouses, one in seven Brighton families earned their living from butchering. Sanitary precautions were rarely taken, however, causing fears of cholera. The state eventually prohibited animal slaughter outside of the Brighton Abattoir, or within six miles of the State House.

Because thousands of transactions couldn’t be accomplished in just one day, in 1830 the Cattle Fair Hotel was built in Brighton for businessmen who needed a place to stay. The hotel had 100 rooms, a dance hall and much more. It was so elegant it even became a honeymoon retreat for newlyweds.

At one end of the garden at the end of a long patch of green sits a white statue of a woman in grief, far from the embrace of roses. A green patina hangs in the crooks of her drapes. She mourns the loss of something beautiful. The statue is named “_Desconsol,’’_ Catalán for desolation. The statue is a replica of Josep Llimona’s original in Barcelona.

How did Mary express her rights? Women had no suffrage then, so she couldn’t vote. Yet, when she fought to regain wealth, she gave the money to the people who lived with her in the boarding house and to her daughter and neighbors. Her daughter Elizabeth also left most of the money in her estate to women, and after her death, the house was sold to a Hannah Bliss for one dollar.

#### Interpretation: The Complexity of Family

Family is a bridge that brings lives together. Sometimes, family memories can be happy: living in the same house, enjoying the times spent together, or creating new family. At the same time, family memories can be burdensome: sharing out properties, resentment of newcomers, or differences in living habits. Mary Emery Pierce went from living with her husband whose family were wealthy landowners to living in a boarding house with no support. In the Pierce family, they didn’t give Mary all she deserved. But she also gave what she had to others. In Mary’s story of family, there was brokenness. Through these experiences, however, Mary showed strength through generosity.

In my opinion, family can be as soft as talc or as strong as graphene. Expectations and hopes were high when my family moved from Vietnam to the U.S., simply because my parents wanted me to have a better education. My siblings were left behind with no clue when we’d be back. Being an immigrant in a foreign country, I had a hard time learning English and supporting my parents, but my family gives me the opportunities to grow and learn, and I will give back all I have.
