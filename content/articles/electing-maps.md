This spring, our education department is teaching an exciting class at the Burke! Based on our [_Maptivist_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/education/k12/maptivists/) program, it's simultaneously the culmination of years of work on teaching maps and race to high schoolers, and a sort of pilot program in teaching a stand-alone geography elective at a local public high school. The course asks the question: how do racial ideas become spatial practice?

In order to answer this, one of the things students have spent a lot of time thinking about is the delineation of neighborhoods in Boston. Where are the boundaries between neighborhoods? What are other ways you could redraw the boundaries? How is race linked to neighborhood, and why? Why, finally, is Boston such a segregated city?

Students are getting an intro in GIS software as well, so that they can add layers of data that matter to them into maps and compare phenomena themselves.
