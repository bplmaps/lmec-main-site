### Power in industrial Boston

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, power stations were fixtures of Boston's landscape. Corporations burned coal to produce gas for lighting, especially at the Boston Gas Light Company's works in the North End. Companies later generated electric light as a utility, for example, at the Edison Electric Illuminating Company's L Street Power Station in South Boston. In addition, corporations often built their own power stations, including the Quincy Market Cold Storage & Warehousing Company's power house on Sargent Wharf and the Boston Elevated Railway Company's power station on Lincoln Wharf. While each complex met the company's distinct demands, Boston's power stations had a lot in common---especially their waterfront locations.

Maps demonstrate how energy production transformed Boston's waterfront. Especially because waterfront property owners were legally permitted to fill land and expand their site to the boundary of low tide (a process called landmaking), corporations remade waterfront sites for power generation.[^1] The industrialists expanded the malleable waterfront to import and store large shipments of coal from steamships (especially desirable since shipping coal through railroads was increasingly expensive). Enterprises also generated power on waterfront sites because steam engines, which typically produced electricity, needed a supply of cold water to cool the equipment and support the station's overall performance. Because inland parcels failed to provide similar benefits, corporations were eager to invest in waterfront land for energy production. Therefore, the history of energy production particularly demonstrates how corporations once reshaped the waterfront as useful and valuable.

Maps also contextualize the ongoing efforts to adapt the sites for new uses and values. The history of energy production left footprints behind, and developers contend with the footprints as they fill the sites with a pastiche of new structures, labor over which buildings to reuse or remove, and fight with other stakeholders about land use on the contested logistics corridors. Despite the challenges, developers reinvested and reasserted the waterfront as valuable. However, developers will struggle to create a permanent and dependable postindustrial waterfront in the future. Due partially to the history of energy production, the sites are particularly susceptible to sea level rise because the corporations previously filled the waterfront at low grades to expeditiously meet commercial demands. Highlighted in the redevelopment approaches and the impending inundation, the history of energy production contextualizes the current strategies and the contemporary challenges for planning Boston's waterfront today.

### The Boston Gas Light Company's Works

The Boston Gas Light Company transformed about 7.5 acres of the North End into a space for energy production. Several businessmen incorporated the Boston Gas Light Company in 1822. Due to the proximity to many customers, the company selected the North End for their gas production site, which was also called a "works." In 1828, the Boston Gas Light Company purchased a parcel of land in the North End {{< popup img-src="/images/blog/making-power/prince-snow-hill.png/" bib-src="https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82m131w" >}}between Commercial Street, Snow Hill Street, Hull Street, and Prince Street{{</ popup >}} for their gas works.[^2] By the 1850s, the Boston Gas Light Company built a wharf and coal sheds on the waterfront. Because the company stored their coal in close proximity to their works on the wharf, the waterfront location allowed the company to control their fuel supply and subsequently bolster productivity.

{{< figure class="figure-left" src="/images/blog/making-power/gas-works-hne.png" >}}

The works also encroached within 50 feet of adjacent dwellings in the North End. In the 1890s, residents fretted to their local representatives about the close proximity to the works, particularly due to "the amount of dark or thick gray smoke issuing from the chimney of the Boston Gas Light Company."[^3] Residents also reported struggles to breathe due to the gas works' emissions, and 22 deaths from asphyxiation were attributed to the increasing pollution.[^4] After the Molasses Flood in 1919, where a 2.3 million gallon tank of industrial molasses in the North End exploded and killed 21 people and injured 150 others, residents issued more formal complaints to municipal officials that the North End gasometer (gas holder) could similarly explode and harm the residents.[^5] Through transforming and expanding their land for gas production, the North End gas works also transcended property boundaries and infringed on residents' domestic comfort and wellbeing. Despite this, an investigation by city officials in 1920 determined that the gas works adhered to municipal building codes and kept the gasometer in place.

> *Using Atlascope, you can compare the 1867 landscape of the Boston Gas Light Company's works to the 2024 modern streets map. The 1867 map demonstrates that the gas "factory" buildings were in close proximity to the rest of the North End buildings, and segmented the parcel of land south of Commercial Street for gas production. The map also demonstrates that the wharf housed a series of coal sheds.*

This history of energy production impacted the North End's built environment patterns, even after the gas company left the neighborhood. The gas company scaled back their production in the early twentieth century and sold portions of the North End site gradually. By 1903, railroad corporations purchased the waterfront property, the North Terminal Corporation acquired a portion of the site and constructed a garage by 1925, and the City of Boston purchased the rest of the site and built a playground by the 1930s.[^6] After the railroad corporations abandoned the waterfront, the city's postwar urban renewal plans then reconfigured the waterfront for recreation. Despite the new land uses, the park, garage, and waterfront still remain exceptions to the dense parcels of brick dwellings in the North End. The spacious parcels and aggregation of structures serve as reminders that the gas works once consumed and carved out the landscape for gas production.

> *Using Atlascope, you can compare the 2023 aerial imagery of the North End to the 1938 atlas. The comparison demonstrates that the history of gas production carved out and distinguished this parcel of land from the rest of the North End. The 1938 atlas shows that the gas works became a garage and a park, while the New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co. used the waterfront. These industries also impacted the landscape - the land south of Commercial Street remain a parking garage and a park to this day, and the railroads prevented any other waterfront development until the postwar period.*

### The Edison Electric Illuminating Company's L Street Power Station 

By the late nineteenth century, new corporations sold a different mode of lighting to customers. The {{< popup img-src="/images/blog/making-power/edison-electric-hne.jpg/" bib-src="https://gusn.us/220288" >}}Edison Electric Illuminating Company (EEIC){{</ popup >}} acquired the L Street Power Station in South Boston by 1902. Afterwards, the L Street Power Station became the EEIC's largest power plant in New England, and consumed about 90,000 tons of coal per year.[^7]

{{< figure class="figure-left" src="/images/blog/making-power/conduits-seawater.png" >}}


The shipment of coal arrived through a significant waterway between the outer harbor and South Boston---called the {{< popup img-src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:1257bb07c/4891,2233,2175,1347/1200,/0/default.jpg" bib-src="https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1257bb063" >}}Reserved Channel{{</ popup >}}---on which the power station was located. The L Street Power Station efficiently produced power because the EEIC built conduits into the waterfront, including pipes that pumped cold seawater into the station, cycled the cold water to cool the equipment, and then expelled the warmed water back into the channel.

The EEIC dredged and remade the Reserved Channel for this infrastructure, and additionally expanded their waterfront site from 22.3 acres to 33.5 acres by driving piles into the harbor.[^8] On their new waterfront land, the EEIC primarily built coal towers, a movable crane, and conveyor equipment that transferred shipments of coal into the station by 1919. As the conduits into the Reserved Channel and the landmaking demonstrate, the EEIC transformed the waterfront and site for the energy production process.

<iframe width=100% height=550px src="https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-71.03357,42.33984$zoom:17.59$base:ark:/76611/al88sh4fq$overlay:ark:/76611/al88svmi0"></iframe>

> *Using Atlascope, you can compare the 1899 atlas to the 1919 atlas to witness how the EEIC transformed the waterfront. In this period, the EEIC made land on the Reserved Channel and expanded the number of buildings within the L Street Power Station complex. The 1919 atlas also details the coal conveyor from the waterfront into the station.*

The L Street Power Station operated into the twenty-first century, but recent plans for the site's future demonstrate how property owners struggle to reconfigure the waterfront. After the station's closure in 2015, developers planned a mixed-use complex for offices, commercial spaces, parks, and apartments.[^9] The plans focused on the adaptive reuse of the turbine building and the construction of new buildings on the rest of the site.

{{< figure class="figure-center" src="/images/blog/making-power/l-street-power.jpg" caption="The planned redevelopment of the L Street Power Station site proposes the adaptive reuse of the power station’s turbine room, and also involves the construction of new buildings and the creation of waterfront public space. ([City of Boston Planning Department, \"776 Summer Street - Phase 1\"](https://www.bostonplans.org/projects/development-projects/776-summer-street-phase-1))" >}}

However, the history of industry on the prominent shipping channel meant that stakeholders enacted land use restrictions, including the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), which due to its operations at the nearby Conley Shipping Terminal, previously prohibited housing on the Reserved Channel.[^10] In 2024, the developers paid Massport to remove the deed restrictions, allowing them to proceed with their plans for the L Street Power Station mixed-use complex.[^11] Nevertheless, the developers still contend with the previous buildings and infrastructure, which necessitate significant clearance and rehabilitation before the site can be viable for postindustrial uses.

> *Using Atlascope, you can compare the 2023 aerial imagery of the L Street Power Station to the 1919 atlas. The comparison demonstrates that some of the power station's facilities and infrastructure no longer remains on the site. In addition, despite the plans for redevelopment, the 2023 aerial imagery showcases how much of the space used for energy generation remains undeveloped at this time.*

### The Quincy Market Cold Storage & Warehousing Company's Sargent Wharf Complex

At the turn of the twentieth century, gas and electricity were primarily sold to customers for lighting. Some corporations invested in their own power stations to fuel their operations. For example, in the late nineteenth century, the Quincy Market Cold Storage & Warehousing Company (QMCS) built warehouses throughout the Boston area.

{{< figure class="figure-left" src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:f1881w417/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" caption="The Quincy Market Cold Storage & Warehousing Company’s warehouse complex on Sargent’s Wharf included several 11-story warehouses along Eastern Avenue. The Power House was at the edge of the wharf, on the righthand side of the image. (Merrill, Richard. [\"Quincy Market Cold Storage and Warehouse Co. building.” Photograph. [ca. 1930–1963]. Digital Commonwealth.)\"](https://ark.digitalcommonwealth.org/ark:/50959/f1881w40z)" >}}


By the 1890s, the QMCS invested in warehouses with engines that mechanically cooled air. Between 1896-1905, the QMCS built new cold storage warehouses on Sargent's Wharf in downtown Boston. The 2 acre location permitted the QMCS to transfer freight from the railroads on Atlantic Avenue and ships on the harbor. The QMCS's warehouse complex on Sargent's Wharf included a power house, which generated cold air and electric light for the warehouse.[^12]

Similar to the Boston Gas Light Company and the EEIC, the QMCS reconfigured the waterfront for coal infrastructure, especially the coal shed on the edge of the wharf. The waterfront proximity granted the QMCS significant control over their coal supply at a key location for cold storage in downtown Boston. In contrast to its neighbors however, the QMCS focused less on expanding the size of their site into the waterfront, and instead replaced the other buildings and tenants on the rest of the wharf. To expand their power house in 1906, the QMCS replaced 65-67 Eastern Avenue, which was a four-story tenement that previously housed seven Italian immigrant families.[^13]

> *Using Atlascope, you can compare the 1895 atlas to the 1917 atlas and witness how the QMCS transformed Sargent's Wharf. In the late nineteenth century, Sargent's Wharf housed many tenants and property owners, including a sugar refinery. However, the QMCS acquired and constructed new cold storage facilities on the wharf throughout the following decades. In particular, the QMCS built a power house at the edge of the wharf, which benefitted from the coal shed that stored maritime shipments of coal.}}*

After Boston experienced deindustrialization---a process whereby many of Boston's manufacturing and industrial enterprises fled for other regions after World War II---the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) planned for urban renewal of city-owned properties. The BRA planned to remove or adapt the older buildings, and encouraged real estate developers to invest in housing, parking garages, hotels, and museums on the waterfront.

{{< figure class="figure-center" src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h14cx789/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" caption="Downtown Waterfront Corporation, and Boston Redevelopment Authority. \"Downtown waterfront-Faneuil Hall urban renewal area Massachusetts R-77.\" [Boston: Boston Redevelopment Authority, February 4, 1964. Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center.](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h14cx771)" >}}

The QMCS abandoned their Sargent's Wharf complex in the 1960s, but the BRA ultimately struggled to envision the warehouse as an adapted commercial or residential space due to its large size and its visual obstruction of the harbor.[^14] According to the planners, the complex retained the legacy of industry, and could not be aligned with the new vision for a postindustrial waterfront. Instead, the BRA demolished the warehouse complex. Although the BRA attempted to attract real estate developers to build new housing facilities on the site after the demolition of the warehouse, Sargent's Wharf remains a parking lot to this day.[^15] Similar to the L Street Power Station, the industrial past reshaped the wharf and challenged redevelopment plans.

> *Using Atlascope, you can compare the 2023 aerial imagery of Sargent's Wharf to the 1938 atlas. The comparison demonstrates how the QMCS's warehouse carved out and segmented the space that eventually became the current parking lot. The legacy of the industrial land use remains, because the City of Boston struggled to find a developer that would invest in a new housing complex on the wharf.*

### The Boston Elevated Railway Company's Lincoln Wharf Power Station 

Other corporations invested in power stations for transportation services. By 1901, the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) built elevated structures for streetcar lines along Washington Street, the Charlestown Bridge, and Atlantic Avenue. At this time, the BERy invested in four power stations (two in downtown, one in East Cambridge, and one in Somerville) for the elevated system. The 2.5 acre Lincoln Wharf site was an ideal location for a power station due to its close proximity to the Atlantic Avenue elevated route.

Using methods that echoed the EEIC's expansion of the L Street Power Station (such as driving wooden piles into the harbor), the BERy significantly reshaped the waterfront's space.[^16] Like most power stations in the period, the operations relied upon a steady and accessible supply of coal shipments, so the BERy built coal pockets to transfer coal into the station.[^17]

In addition, the Lincoln Wharf Power Station used the harbor's cold seawater to cool the steam-powered equipment, similar to the process at the L Street Power Station. However, the harbor did not always supply seawater reliably -- for example, in 1906, the *Boston Daily Globe* reported that a particularly low tide prevented the BERy from intaking seawater at all four of their power stations, which resulted in "crawling cars," and delayed service where "a great many people got disgusted while the elevated was wrestling with the difficulty and left the cars, preferring to walk."[^18]

> *Using Atlascope, you can compare the 1898 atlas to the 1908 modern atlas and witness how the BERy transformed Lincoln Wharf. The map demonstrates that the BERy made land north of Union Wharf, constructed the brick power house near Commercial Street, and invested in coal pockets at the edge of Lincoln Wharf.*

The Lincoln Wharf Power Station's history of energy production carved out landscapes and buildings that were later redeveloped for housing by the late twentieth century. The MBTA (the successor to the BERy) owned the Lincoln Wharf Power Station by the 1970s, at which time they determined that they no longer needed the power station. By 1979, the San Marco Corporation, a nonprofit arm of the Sacred Heart Church in the North End, acquired the property and planned to offer a quarter of the units at affordable rates.[^19]

{{< figure class="figure-right" src="/images/blog/making-power/lincoln-wharf-today.jpg" caption="The Lincoln Wharf Power Station was adaptively reused for apartments, which remains the building's function to this day. Author's Photo, 2023." >}}

The development corporation reused the Lincoln Wharf power station building for the new apartment complex, which opened by 1987. In addition, private developers built new housing complexes on the spaces originally used for the power station's infrastructure. By 1993, the Kenney Development Corporation completed the Burrough's Wharf project on the site of the coal pockets, which offers luxury condos to this day.[^20] The redevelopment of Lincoln Wharf relied upon aggregations of housing structures, which necessitated strategic and intentional planning to adapt the space formerly carved out and made for energy production.

> *Using Atlascope, you can compare the 2023 aerial imagery of Lincoln Wharf to the 1908 atlas. The comparison demonstrates that the power station remained in place as an apartment complex. The aerial imagery also captures the Burrough's Wharf condo complex on the former coal pocket on Lincoln Wharf and on the East Boston North Ferry terminal. The maps showcase how developers remade the site for housing after the MBTA no longer used the land for power production.*

### Will the Made Land be Unmade?

Energy production works and stations reshaped Boston's waterfront in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Boston Gas Light Company, the Edison Electric Illuminating Company, the Quincy Market Cold Storage & Warehousing Company, and the Boston Elevated Railway Company remade, expanded, and altered waterfront spaces to meet their operational needs. To generate profit and produce gas or electric power, the companies impacted and displaced residents, altered harbor geography, and produced long-term spatial impacts on land use. Similar to each corporation in the past, contemporary developers also attempt to create value from these sites today. While other developers struggle to adapt a range of industrial sites (such as train yards, factory buildings, etc.), the history of the power works and stations particularly impact redevelopment. Industrialists once built power stations in close proximity to the harbor with layered and intricate infrastructure into and on the waterfront, and due this history, developers either filled the large spaces with a miscellany of structures (seen at the North End gas works and the Lincoln Wharf Power Station) or struggle to receive support and approval to entice new investments (exemplified by the L Street Power Station and Sargent's Wharf).

When they were constructed, the power works and stations exemplified how property owners adapted the waterfront as valuable and useful space, which is also the approach that contemporary developers employ to remake the waterfront today. However, foraging forward with new land uses and developments will not protect each site's value forever, especially due to the waterfront's environmental vulnerabilities that also trace back to energy production. To meet commercial and industrial demands expeditiously, property owners made waterfront land at low grades. As the annotated map of Climate Ready Boston's flooding progression demonstrates, much of the city's made land, including the four waterfront sites, will flood by 2070. Like they did in the past, private developers largely own and reshape Boston's waterfront, but the redevelopment strategy for former industrial sites, especially power stations, remains focused on making useful and valuable landscapes rather than preparing for inundation. If we stay on the current course, the question should be asked: will the made land eventually be unmade?

{{< figure class="figure-center" src="/images/blog/making-power/Kane_ClimateReadyBoston_AnnotatedMap.png" caption="In 2015, the City of Boston established the Climate Ready Boston initiative. The initiative focused on researching and proposing strategies for Boston's resilience to climate change. Climate Ready Boston created maps of three sea level rise scenarios that could happen within the next century: 9 inches, 21 inches, and 36 inches. The highest sea level rise, 36 inches, is very likely by 2070, if, according to Climate Ready Boston, \"emissions remain at the current level or even if there is a moderate reduction in emissions.\" The annotated Climate Ready Boston map indicates that the four sites of energy production will likely be inundated with flooding from monthly high tides. Much of the sites also have a 10% chance of flooding annually (10% Storm), and a 1% chance of flooding annually (1% Storm)." >}}
