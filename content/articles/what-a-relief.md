[This model](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2829450075) shows the process for making 3D raised relief maps in the early 20th century. Using a topographic map with contour lines, a model was built up in layers of cardboard, filled with plaster to smooth out the edges, and covered with shellac. Usually a mold was made from the model, and was then used to create plaster or plastic casts.⁠  
⁠  
This model is based on [USGS topographic quadrangles](http://guides.bpl.org/usgs-maps) of the Sunapee Mountain area in New Hampshire. Concentric circles show each stage of of the process, with pins and labels identifying each step.⁠  
⁠  
This technique for making raised relief maps was followed by vacuum-forming plastic over a mold, which was cheaper and faster. Vacuum-forming is still used today, with 3D printing becoming another common method.⁠
