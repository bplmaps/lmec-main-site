Academia is one of the defining features of the Greater Boston Area. Higher education institutions draw tens of thousands of students from all over the world and have them live in the neighborhoods they are located in. It takes an array of buildings and facilities to run a functional college or university; buildings and facilities that take up great portions of land. What ends up happening is, as the size and prestige of a college grows, the size of the neighborhoods and communities that surround it shrinks. Though not the sole reason, college expansion contributes heavily to the increasing cost of living and decreasing amount of space in neighborhoods. When the driver for a neighborhood’s gentrification is this massive, money-making institution exempt from taxes, it may feel impossible to prevent, but it is amazing what a loud, vocal, and persistent community is capable of.

When looking at a map of Chinatown, its history of being meddled with can be visualized. There’s the Central Artery, a highway through Chinatown built in the 1950s that took the place of over 50 housing structures. There’s the Massachusetts Turnpike Extension, built shortly after the Central Artery had been built, destroying around 60 housing structures in Chinatown in its construction. The two highways were built for the benefit of residents of Boston’s suburban neighborhoods but at the expense of the populous urban neighborhood they cut through. Then, in the 1970s, Tufts New England Medical Center (T-NEMC) began to buy more land in Chinatown with the help of the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA). The hospital nearly tripled in size that decade. T-NEMC used its space to build tall multi-story buildings and dense parking complexes, but its parking lots and medical services were not heavily used by actual Chinatown residents, benefitting its doctors and practicing students more than the surrounding community.
