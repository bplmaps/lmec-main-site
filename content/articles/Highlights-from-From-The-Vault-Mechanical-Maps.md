> On May 26, we hosted [From The Vault: Mechanical Maps](https://www.leventhalmap.org/event/from-the-vault-collections-showing-mechanical-maps/)! From The Vault is a biweekly event series showing collections objects selected by Map Center staff. For this edition the series, we looked at objects from our collections that move!
