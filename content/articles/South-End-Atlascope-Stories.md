> Over two days in August, the Map Center hired three Boston Public School students to use Atlascope to explore different neighborhoods and write an article together about what they discovered. Their work featured here is connected to our recent [Building Blocks exhibition](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/), which features a variety of stories taken from the urban atlas collections.

[Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/) is a tool used for exploring the history of Boston, by looking at how it has changed over time. It is a project started by the Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library. The website has atlases for all the neighborhoods of Boston as well as some surrounding cities and towns. Atlascope can be used to track buildings ownership, trace your own family ties in Boston, and learn about the history of the Greater Boston area. When we were first looking at Atlascope, it was apparent that the South End neighborhood had a history worth exploring. The land area that the South End sits on was filled in during 1848, with the intention of the South End to be a wealthy neighborhood. After the landfill was completed, rows of townhouses and brownstones filled the streets of the neighborhood. As time went on, the South End was looking less attractive when compared to Back Bay, and the richer South End residents moved there. For years after the development of Back Bay, the South End was largely made up of lower income families and individuals. The South End became a safe haven for struggling artists as well. Since the late-1970s, however, gentrification drove out the many immigrants and lower income residents. We picked the South End for this project because of how much it’s changed over time, and how gentrification affects the neighborhood today.

&#x9;Using Atlascope, we collected data on differences in the South End–looking at maps from 1882-1938 and comparing them to maps from today. We then chose to focus on three case studies that we felt best represented the history of the neighborhood and the changes it has experienced. Each case study explores one or a few locations that were pivotal in the history of the South End and how these changes can be seen using Atlascope. 

The first case study, “The Beginning of Gentrification in the South End,” looks at developments in housing in the South End through Atlascope. Focusing on the Cyclorama and other arts districts in the South End, this case study evaluates the changes these spaces brought to the neighborhood. There we could see the roots of the gentrification that would soon hit this community leading to a drastic change in the neighborhood.

The second case study, “The Lasting Impact of Settlement Houses in the South End,” focuses on the settlement houses that were established in the South End around the turn of the century. These institutions primarily served the growing immigrant populations of the neighborhood and provided them with housing, and social, economic, and recreational opportunities. We chose to tell the story of these organizations and the communities of the South End through three locations that were once owned and operated by the South End Settlement House. The diverging fates of these buildings provides an insight into what has changed in the South End and what has remained the same. 

The third case study, “The Lost School of the South End,” discusses the history of the Girls’ High School, which was opened in 1852, and educated mostly young women before it was closed in 1974. The school educated many renowned women, and had a prestigious reputation for years. When it closed a lot of the history behind the school and its alumni faded, so we chose to bring their stories to light again.
