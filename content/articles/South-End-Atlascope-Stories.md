> Over two days in August, the Map Center hired three Boston Public School students to use Atlascope to explore different neighborhoods and write an article together about what they discovered. Their work featured here is connected to our recent [Building Blocks exhibition](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/), which features a variety of stories taken from the urban atlas collections.

[Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/) is a tool used for exploring the history of Boston, by looking at how it has changed over time. It is a project started by the Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library. The website has atlases for all the neighborhoods of Boston as well as some surrounding cities and towns. Atlascope can be used to track buildings ownership, trace your own family ties in Boston, and learn about the history of the Greater Boston area. When we were first looking at Atlascope, it was apparent that the South End neighborhood had a history worth exploring. The land area that the South End sits on was filled in during 1848, with the intention of the South End to be a wealthy neighborhood. After the landfill was completed, rows of townhouses and brownstones filled the streets of the neighborhood. As time went on, the South End was looking less attractive when compared to Back Bay, and the richer South End residents moved there. For years after the development of Back Bay, the South End was largely made up of lower income families and individuals. The South End became a safe haven for struggling artists as well. Since the late-1970s, however, gentrification drove out the many immigrants and lower income residents. We picked the South End for this project because of how much it’s changed over time, and how gentrification affects the neighborhood today.

&#x9;Using Atlascope, we collected data on differences in the South End–looking at maps from 1882-1938 and comparing them to maps from today. We then chose to focus on three case studies that we felt best represented the history of the neighborhood and the changes it has experienced. Each case study explores one or a few locations that were pivotal in the history of the South End and how these changes can be seen using Atlascope. 

The first case study, “The Beginning of Gentrification in the South End,” looks at developments in housing in the South End through Atlascope. Focusing on the Cyclorama and other arts districts in the South End, this case study evaluates the changes these spaces brought to the neighborhood. There we could see the roots of the gentrification that would soon hit this community leading to a drastic change in the neighborhood.

The second case study, “The Lasting Impact of Settlement Houses in the South End,” focuses on the settlement houses that were established in the South End around the turn of the century. These institutions primarily served the growing immigrant populations of the neighborhood and provided them with housing, and social, economic, and recreational opportunities. We chose to tell the story of these organizations and the communities of the South End through three locations that were once owned and operated by the South End Settlement House. The diverging fates of these buildings provides an insight into what has changed in the South End and what has remained the same. 

The third case study, “The Lost School of the South End,” discusses the history of the Girls’ High School, which was opened in 1852, and educated mostly young women before it was closed in 1974. The school educated many renowned women, and had a prestigious reputation for years. When it closed a lot of the history behind the school and its alumni faded, so we chose to bring their stories to light again. 

### The Beginning of Gentrification in the South End

By Winona Wardwell

Gentrification has become a large, controversial issue in Boston. All neighborhoods are now struggling to maintain the community that has lived there for decades while also trying to adapt to growing housing prices. The South End is no exception. In the past centuries, they have experienced a complete change in community because of new developments.

When the land around Downtown and South Boston was originally filled in the mid 1800s, its purpose was to create homes downtown for rich Bostonians. Yet this plan failed when the new Back Bay was established. The wealthy flocked further to new, stylish parts of the city, leaving the South End without a large part of its past population. The open buildings attracted a whole new demographic of people from all over the world seeking jobs and cheap housing. Emigrants from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa moved there, in addition to people from other parts of the country like African Americans from the South during the Great Migration. Soon the neighborhood had all types of food, religious buildings, and people. These people flourished with tons of jobs in the neighborhood due to the surrounding lumber yards, furniture factories, and machine shops on Briston Street, which is modern day Paul Sullivan Way. 

In the late 1800s, theaters, operas, and hotels started popping up in the neighborhood in places that used to be housing. The most unique of all of these art facilities was the Cyclorama, which made its debut in 1884 on Tremont Street. The Cyclorama is a large circular building created for a specific purpose: to hold French artist Paul Dominique Philippoteaux’s panoramic paintings of the Battle of Gettysburg from the Civil War. The opening of this building was monumental, and people flocked from all over the city to see these paintings that Philippoteaux had spent years on.

Once the paintings moved to Philadelphia in 1891 (and eventually to the Gettysburg National Military Park), the Cyclorama housed all types of entertainment for Bostonians from paintings of Hawaiian volcanoes to boxing events in the early 1900s. Then the Cyclorama became a flower exchange before being bought by the Boston Arts Center in 1971. While the Cyclorama was showing exhibitions, however, the tickets were expensive and most of the South End community were excluded from attending these one of a kind events. As wealthier people came into South End, they brought more expensive businesses with them, raising prices in the community. The Cyclorama marks the beginning of gentrification in the South End, but it was only a taste of what was to come.

Here one can see the changes around the Cyclorama. In 1888, there were a variety of small buildings used for apartments and factories. By 1912, however, there were larger buildings centered around activities for the wealthy and no housing on the block. 

Similarly, on Ashland Place from 1870 to 1902, there was a similar pattern of housing becoming theaters and operas–activities that typically require a certain amount of financial stability.

After the Great Depression and both World Wars, the neighborhood fell into disrepair, and became the target for new development from private companies in addition to the local government. By the 1960s, wealthy people had taken over the once utilitarian factories and turned them into industrial modern apartments. Soon the South End was one of the richest parts of Boston, and the people who had once lived there had fled all over Greater Boston. Memories of the former community can still be seen in the architecture, as the bones of the large factories still remain, despite the purpose of the building being different. For example, Washington Street where the theaters used to be there is now affordable housing for artists. This housing offers people a chance to stay in their community and preserve some of the culture. Still, looking at the neighborhood, it is hardly a window into the culture that once flourished in this community.
