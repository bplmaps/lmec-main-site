> Over two days in August, the Map Center hired three Boston Public School students to use Atlascope to explore different neighborhoods and write an article together about what they discovered. Their work featured here is connected to our recent [Building Blocks exhibition](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/), which features a variety of stories taken from the urban atlas collections.

[Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/) is a tool used for exploring the history of Boston, by looking at how it has changed over time. It is a project started by the Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library. The website has atlases for all the neighborhoods of Boston as well as some surrounding cities and towns. Atlascope can be used to track buildings ownership, trace your own family ties in Boston, and learn about the history of the Greater Boston area. When we were first looking at Atlascope, it was apparent that the South End neighborhood had a history worth exploring. The land area that the South End sits on was filled in during 1848, with the intention of the South End to be a wealthy neighborhood. After the landfill was completed, rows of townhouses and brownstones filled the streets of the neighborhood. As time went on, the South End was looking less attractive when compared to Back Bay, and the richer South End residents moved there. For years after the development of Back Bay, the South End was largely made up of lower income families and individuals. The South End became a safe haven for struggling artists as well. Since the late-1970s, however, gentrification drove out the many immigrants and lower income residents. We picked the South End for this project because of how much it’s changed over time, and how gentrification affects the neighborhood today.

&#x9;Using Atlascope, we collected data on differences in the South End–looking at maps from 1882-1938 and comparing them to maps from today. We then chose to focus on three case studies that we felt best represented the history of the neighborhood and the changes it has experienced. Each case study explores one or a few locations that were pivotal in the history of the South End and how these changes can be seen using Atlascope. 

The first case study, “The Beginning of Gentrification in the South End,” looks at developments in housing in the South End through Atlascope. Focusing on the Cyclorama and other arts districts in the South End, this case study evaluates the changes these spaces brought to the neighborhood. There we could see the roots of the gentrification that would soon hit this community leading to a drastic change in the neighborhood.

The second case study, “The Lasting Impact of Settlement Houses in the South End,” focuses on the settlement houses that were established in the South End around the turn of the century. These institutions primarily served the growing immigrant populations of the neighborhood and provided them with housing, and social, economic, and recreational opportunities. We chose to tell the story of these organizations and the communities of the South End through three locations that were once owned and operated by the South End Settlement House. The diverging fates of these buildings provides an insight into what has changed in the South End and what has remained the same. 

The third case study, “The Lost School of the South End,” discusses the history of the Girls’ High School, which was opened in 1852, and educated mostly young women before it was closed in 1974. The school educated many renowned women, and had a prestigious reputation for years. When it closed a lot of the history behind the school and its alumni faded, so we chose to bring their stories to light again. 

### The Beginning of Gentrification in the South End

***By Winona Wardwell***

Gentrification has become a large, controversial issue in Boston. All neighborhoods are now struggling to maintain the community that has lived there for decades while also trying to adapt to growing housing prices. The South End is no exception. In the past centuries, they have experienced a complete change in community because of new developments.

When the land around Downtown and South Boston was originally filled in the mid 1800s, its purpose was to create homes downtown for rich Bostonians. Yet this plan failed when the new Back Bay was established. The wealthy flocked further to new, stylish parts of the city, leaving the South End without a large part of its past population. The open buildings attracted a whole new demographic of people from all over the world seeking jobs and cheap housing. Emigrants from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa moved there, in addition to people from other parts of the country like African Americans from the South during the Great Migration. Soon the neighborhood had all types of food, religious buildings, and people. These people flourished with tons of jobs in the neighborhood due to the surrounding lumber yards, furniture factories, and machine shops on Briston Street, which is modern day Paul Sullivan Way. 

In the late 1800s, theaters, operas, and hotels started popping up in the neighborhood in places that used to be housing. The most unique of all of these art facilities was the Cyclorama, which made its debut in 1884 on Tremont Street. The Cyclorama is a large circular building created for a specific purpose: to hold French artist Paul Dominique Philippoteaux’s panoramic paintings of the Battle of Gettysburg from the Civil War. The opening of this building was monumental, and people flocked from all over the city to see these paintings that Philippoteaux had spent years on.

Once the paintings moved to Philadelphia in 1891 (and eventually to the Gettysburg National Military Park), the Cyclorama housed all types of entertainment for Bostonians from paintings of Hawaiian volcanoes to boxing events in the early 1900s. Then the Cyclorama became a flower exchange before being bought by the Boston Arts Center in 1971. While the Cyclorama was showing exhibitions, however, the tickets were expensive and most of the South End community were excluded from attending these one of a kind events. As wealthier people came into South End, they brought more expensive businesses with them, raising prices in the community. The Cyclorama marks the beginning of gentrification in the South End, but it was only a taste of what was to come.

Here one can see the changes around the Cyclorama. In 1888, there were a variety of small buildings used for apartments and factories. By 1912, however, there were larger buildings centered around activities for the wealthy and no housing on the block. 

Similarly, on Ashland Place from 1870 to 1902, there was a similar pattern of housing becoming theaters and operas–activities that typically require a certain amount of financial stability.

After the Great Depression and both World Wars, the neighborhood fell into disrepair, and became the target for new development from private companies in addition to the local government. By the 1960s, wealthy people had taken over the once utilitarian factories and turned them into industrial modern apartments. Soon the South End was one of the richest parts of Boston, and the people who had once lived there had fled all over Greater Boston. Memories of the former community can still be seen in the architecture, as the bones of the large factories still remain, despite the purpose of the building being different. For example, Washington Street where the theaters used to be there is now affordable housing for artists. This housing offers people a chance to stay in their community and preserve some of the culture. Still, looking at the neighborhood, it is hardly a window into the culture that once flourished in this community.

### Lost School of the South End

***By Bridget Hurley***

The Girls High and Normal School was opened in 1852, on the top floor of a library on Mason Street, to educate young women to be primary school teachers. The overwhelming influx of interest in attending forced the school to construct a new building on 75 W. Newton Street in 1869. The school was in constant change; In 1876, the Normal School, the school for younger grades, split from the High School and moved to a new campus. The High School remained on W. Newton Street.  Then, the High School shared facilities with Girls’ Latin School (now Boston Latin Academy). From 1876 to 1885, many advancements to the school were made such as wholesome lunches, better ventilation, rearranging seating to provide better illumination, and fire drills.

The Girls’ High School’s reputation grew as the city did. With the annexation of new neighborhoods such as Roxbury (1868), Brighton, Charlestown, Dorchester, and West Roxbury (all 1874), the school became known as one of the most prestigious girls’ schools in the area, and got the reputation for being the “the chief source of supply of teachers for the Boston schools” (Girls’ High and Normal School Alumnae, Olivia B. White). By the mid 1870s, the school had reached its full potential of engaging young girls and preparing them for their lives, in both the workforce and at home. The only thing that was missing was the same college preparatory curriculum that most boys in school had. So, in 1878, the Girls’ High School and the Girls’ Latin School started to increase the shared facilities. This step was taken because the Girls’ Latin School followed the same course of study as Boston Latin School. Although the schools had different leadership, the combination of schools was described as the largest high school in New England, with nearly 800 young women 14 to 22 years old, and a variety of courses offered like Latin, French, German, and English.

Despite how well things seemed to be going at this point, in 1903, the Boston Globe described the space as “insufficient”. To fix this issue, the Latin School moved to a building in Fenway. In addition, the mass waves of immigration that occurred in the early twentieth century also affected the Girls’ High School. At the same time, the school diversified, with students representing over 25 different nationalities. Throughout the 1920s the school was established as “the pride of Boston” and praised frequently. However, the overcrowding made the buildings cramped and difficult to learn in. The school was closed by the City of Boston in 1974, and the building was demolished after that. In 1986, a park was built on that land. I chose this school to write about because I thought it was interesting how quickly this renowned school was demolished. It was considered to be one of the best places for young women to further educate themselves, and the city decided to permanently close it and make the land a park.

Many outstanding women attended this school, including Melnea Cass, activist; Ruth Roman, actress; Lillian A. Lewis, the first black female journalist in Boston; and Marcella Boveri, the first woman to ever graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Instead of demolishing the building, I think that they should’ve created a museum, highlighting the school’s achievements and the achievements of the alumni. The fact that instead of preserving the history of the school, they destroyed it, reflects what was going on in the South End in this period. The neighborhood of the South End had become more inhabited by the working class, which unfortunately brought more crime and danger to the neighborhood, mostly due to the lack of investment by the City of Boston and the increased poverty.

It’s a shame that the Girls’ High and Normal School was closed and not preserved at all. Other schools that had similar statuses at the time are now still open. Why couldn’t the Girls’ High and Normal School be listed amongst Boston Latin, Latin Academy, or O'Bryant? Or, why wasn’t the history of the school taught to more people? It’s only since I recently started using Atlascope that I discovered this treasure lost in history. Viewing old maps is a great way to see how cities change, and how common that change was in the South End. The neighborhood went through many changes in its short history, starting when the land in that area was filled, in 1849, to now. The South End neighborhood is just so enriched with history that the less protected things are easily lost. The Girls High and Normal School was at one time a great place for young women, and now that it's gone, it’s important to focus on preserving the memory so the incredible history of these young women in Boston doesn’t fade.
