> Over two days in August, the Map Center hired three Boston Public School students to use Atlascope to explore different neighborhoods and write an article together about what they discovered. Their work featured here is connected to our recent [Building Blocks exhibition](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/), which features a variety of stories taken from the urban atlas collections.
