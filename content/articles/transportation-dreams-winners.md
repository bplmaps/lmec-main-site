In December, as part of our [Cartography Challenges](https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/cartography-challenge/) program, we opened a call for ["transporatation dreams"](https://leventhalmap.org/), and you overwhelmed us with your ambitious, creative, and thoughtful responses to the prompt: to **depict a speculative transit system of the greater Boston area**. What sorts of new lines would you draw, new maps would you make, and new ideas would you imagine?

As much as we loved everyone's submissions, there were two that rose to the top of the pack.
