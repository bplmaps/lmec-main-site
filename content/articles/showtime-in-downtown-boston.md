The [BRA Collection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/collections/commonwealth:7h14cv132) is currently 124 historic city planning maps of Boston that we introduced to you [here](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/a-new-view-into-urban-renewal-in-boston/)! The map we're talking about today is a map of the theatre district in downtown Boston.
