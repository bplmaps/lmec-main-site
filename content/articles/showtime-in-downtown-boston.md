Welcom back to the [BRA Collection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/collections/commonwealth:7h14cv132), a whopping 124 historic city planning maps of Boston that we introduced to you [here](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/a-new-view-into-urban-renewal-in-boston/)! The map we're talking about today is a map of the theater district in downtown Boston.

This map tells a story about the preservation or lack thereof of historic theaters in Boston, which supposedly has the second highest concentration of old theaters outside of New York. The plan this map lays out is to revitalize the theater district as a "multi-faceted Cultural District," complete with places to eat, shop, and engage in public art. To what extent did Boston succeed in creating a modern and bustling cultural district downtown?

The theaters downtown had a long history before this 1988 redevelopment map was drawn up. The opera house, for example, was already the Academy of Music in 1861, on our oldest [Atlascope](http://atlascope.leventhalmap.org) layer.

The Academy of Music property became the Boston Theatre, which was replaced by the Keith Memorial Theatre by 1928. You can see in this Atlascope view, by swiping back and forth, what changed in the neighborhood in between 1922 and 1928. Most of the other theaters are still there between those two years, including the Bijou Dream, Keith's Theatre, and Modern Theatre.

By panning around the map above, you can see the plethora of theaters that are duplicated on the BRA map. Some, like the Gaiety Theatre at 659 Washington St., stood vacant in 1988. The BRA seems to have considered it "substantially altered," and therefore not "worthy of preservation." Gaiety(/Publix), in the upper left corner of this crop of the BRA map, was razed in 2005.

Others, or their descendants, remain in use today. Modern Theatre, for example, still exists in its original location as a part of Suffolk University, although only the facade of theb building is original. Like several of the other theaters downtown, it has been both a movie and stage theater during its long and storied life.
