The [BRA Collection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/collections/commonwealth:7h14cv132) is currently 124 historic city planning maps of Boston that we introduced to you [here](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/a-new-view-into-urban-renewal-in-boston/)! The map we're talking about today is a map of the theater district in downtown Boston.

The theaters downtown had a long history before this 1988 redevelopment map was drawn up. The opera house, for example, was already the Academy of Music in 1861, on our oldest Atlascope layer.

The Academy of Music property became the Boston Theatre, which was replaced by the Keith Memorial Theatre by 1928. You can see in this Atlascope view, by swiping back and forth, what changed in the neighborhood in between 1922 and 1928.
