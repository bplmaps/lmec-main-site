  nineteenth and twentieth centuries—and their ongoing legacies today.

The Leventhal Center has an extraordinary collection of [urban atlases](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93\&f%5Bcollection_name_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Urban+Maps+%28Collection+of+Distinction%29\&f%5Bsubject_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Boston+%28Mass.%29--Maps\&search_field=dummy_range\&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=1860\&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bend%5D=1950\&commit=Apply) dating from the late 19th to early 20th centuries, one of the most important sets of documents for depicting how our city and region have changed over time. Our [Atlascope tool](https://www.atlascope.org/) has transformed 110 of these atlases into a web interface overlaying the modern map, covering historic Boston and its immediate surrounding towns.

Earlier this year, we released an upgraded version of Atlascope with new features to empower [storytelling](https://www.atlascope.org), annotation, and discovery, as well as connections into other Massachusetts digital collections. One of these new features is a tour feature, which allows individual Atlascope users to narrate their own historical story on a theme or topic important to them. Just like a physical walking tour, these annotated tours lead the tour-taker through specific sites in and around Boston, highlighting important buildings, streets, or relevant facts, and illuminating historical tidbits among the atlas layers.

Whether it’s a tour of the best parks in your neighborhood, tracing underground subway routes, or chronicling the changing landscape of Boston’s music and theater scenes in the twentieth century,  **Atlascope Tours** allow you—as either the creator or the tour-taker—to take a stroll through Boston history, exploring the city from the comfort of your couch and screen.

> **We have three, new Atlascope tours to share! Click on each title below to take the tour.**

### Two tours by Boston Latin School students

The following Atlascope tours were researched, written, and created by Boston Latin School students [Zoe Colimon](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/zoe-colimon/) and [Salman Uddin](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/salman-uddin/) over the course of their Summer 2023 Seevak Fellowship with the Leventhal Center working on public projects related to maps and social justice. 

#### [Profit at a Cost: The Untold History of Massachusetts' Rubber Industry](https://www.atlascope.org)

Though it's unusual to see the history of Boston linked to early American rubber manufacturing, the industry has deep roots in the city. Furthermore, like most widespread manufacturing processes, this local story is also a global one and is tied to extractive colonialism, enslavement and brutal labor practices.

#### [Town and Gown: The Story of Harvard University's Expansion and Its Impact](https://www.atlascope.org)

Harvard College has always been a part of the city of Cambridge's history. It was an influential institution ever since its founding in 1636, but its size and impact have grown and continue to grow. What does this mean for surrounding communities?
