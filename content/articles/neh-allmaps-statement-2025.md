[Allmaps](https://allmaps.org/) is a set of tools that make it easier and more fun to work with digitized maps in library collections. It’s especially great for georeferencing, or overlaying old maps on modern geographies, which can turn historical maps into vastly more useful research tools. At the Leventhal Center, we do lots of georeferencing, so we, along with our friends at the [American Geographical Society Library](https://uwm.edu/libraries/agsl/) (AGSL), have been huge fans of Allmaps for years.

Because we wanted to help make Allmaps even more powerful for members of the public, together we applied for a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to support its ongoing development and long-term sustainability. In August 2023, we were awarded a Digital Humanities Advancement Grant (DHAG) for this work. Over 18 months, we connected with colleagues, researchers, and map enthusiasts from Palo Alto to Paris, from Colombia to Kentucky, in the spirit of bringing old maps to life and creating new opportunities for people to explore the world around them.

Sadly, on April 17, 2025, we learned that the federal government terminated many NEH grants, including ours. The notification stated that our grant’s termination was “necessary to safeguard the interests of the federal government.” There are many headlines in the news these days, and it’s easy to miss stories like this—which is why we felt it was important to share this update with you, our community. This project was carried out with you in mind, and we believe that it expressed a spirit of democratic civic participation that reflects the United States at its best.

Although we’re disappointed that the U.S. government is backing away from supporting projects like Allmaps, LMEC and AGSL will keep working to support the Allmaps project (and we’re thankful that it has support from European agencies). Here at Leventhal Center, we often say that the best part of our collection is that it’s yours: as a member of the public, these maps belong to you. So did this grant. Although losing this funding means you will have fewer opportunities to work with public map collections, we’ll continue investing in our mission to keep making educational, civic-minded projects for your enjoyment and use.
