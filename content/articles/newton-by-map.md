On May 10, we hosted Newton By Map, a historical geography event based around our urban atlases of the city of Newton, MA. Newton was first settled by colonists in 1630, the same year the city of Boston was founded. We don't have property atlases from back then, but it was incorporated as a city in 1874, and we _do_ have an atlas from that year!

This is that colorful atlas by Hopkins, which includes a zoomed in section along Washington St. with more detail.

### Silver Lake

If we compare that atlas to the latest atlas we have for Newton in 1929, we can see how land is developed and broken up over time. This view of Silver Lake below is a great example of larger estates and undeveloped land being divided up into smaller, more built-up plots.

This also explains where Silver Lake Ave got its name! Without maps like these that allow us to compare the past to modern day geography, we wouldn't be able to solve this mystery.

### Hose & Shoddy

Newton had quite a few fabric and clothes factories in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Hosiery usually means stockings, although in this case it could also be a euphemism for all ladies' undergarments. Shoddy is a type of recycled wool or wool fabric made by shredding wool rags and reconstituting them.
