### 2021 Acquisition Roundup

2021 was a busy year for the Map Center! We welcomed tens of thousands of visitors to our [digital](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/) and in-person Bending Lines exhibition, engaged with over 150 K-12 educators, introduced new faces to our team, and brought 85 new physical materials into our [collection](https://www.leventhalmap.org/collections/).

These new acquisitions range from early depictions of New England to original maps created by underrepresented cartographers in the twentieth century. Our active acquisition program allows us to diversify the voices in our collection, support researchers’ interests, and enhance our exhibitions and programs.

> Let's take a closer look a few new additions to the LMEC collection!

#### Folklore (Gropper's Version) 

{{< figure src="/uploads/2021-12-29/folklore.jpeg" caption="William Gropper, “[William Gropper’s America, its folklore](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8038083),” (\[New York\]: \[Associated American Artists\], 1946)." class="figure-right" >}}

Taylor Swift’s [Folklore](https://g.co/kgs/jcZGEi) was one of the biggest albums of 2020, and William Groppers’ “[America, Its Folkore](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8038083)” is one of our favorite finds from 2021. Like Swift's album, Gropper’s map has tricky history of trust, betrayal, and misunderstanding.

During **World War** II, Gropper worked with the [U.S. Treasury Department and the White House’s Office of War Information](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/william-gropper-map-american-folklore) to present “[specific war information objectives](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/william-gropper-map-american-folklore)” in pictorial form on propaganda materials. Gropper was recognized and praised for his contributions, and included in the [State Department’s Overseas Library Program](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/william-gropper-map-american-folklore) from 1946 to 1953; as part of the program, over 1,700 copies of his 1946 [map](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8038083) were distributed to libraries across the globe.

Upon first glance, the map paints a whimsical portrayal of American folklore, highlighting the figures of Paul Bunyan, Johnny Appleseed, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Huck Finn, and many, many more. Within these figures, the State Department saw an opportunity to promote the United States as a “[fun-loving, welcoming, and, most important, free land](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/william-gropper-map-american-folklore).”

#### An Interesting World in an Interesting Time

{{< figure src="/uploads/2021-12-29/its-an-interesting-world.jpeg" caption="R. M. Chapin Jr., “[It’s an interesting world in an interesting time / TIME map by R.M. Chapin, Jr. and J. Donovan; Time, Inc.](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8079826),” (\[New York\] : Time Inc., \[1959\])." class="figure-left" >}}

May you live in an interesting world in an interesting time! This cartoony [poster](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8079826) comes right from the pages of a 1959 edition of **TIME Magazine**. Although the map’s aesthetic style suggests a sense of lightheartedness, the graphics depict some quite frightening developments of the **Cold War** and **Space Race**; we see Khrushchev raising a fist toward Europe, various political leaders facing off, references to atomic explosions in parts of Russia and the United States, and oversized space crafts circling the globe.

The projection choice of this map is particularly fitting. Created in [1943](https://www.wired.com/2014/01/projection-raisz-armadillo/) by Hungarian cartographer Erwin Raisz, the armadillo projection attempts to display a map with the “[lively look of a globe](https://www.wired.com/2014/01/projection-raisz-armadillo/),” that is, to make a “[flat map... look 3-dimensional](https://www.wired.com/2014/01/projection-raisz-armadillo/).” As placed within the context of the year 1959, the projection allows for a display of all critical world events, both on the surface of the Earth and in the atmosphere of space.
