### 2021 Acquisition Roundup

2021 was a busy year for the Map Center! We welcomed tens of thousands of visitors to our [digital](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/) and in-person Bending Lines exhibition, engaged with over 150 K-12 educators, introduced new faces to our team, and brought 85 new physical materials into our [collection](https://www.leventhalmap.org/collections/).

These new acquisitions range from early depictions of New England to original maps created by underrepresented cartographers in the twentieth century. Our active acquisition program allows us to diversify the voices in our collection, support researchers’ interests, and enhance our exhibitions and programs.

May you live in an interesting world in an interesting time! This cartoony [poster](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8079826) comes right from the pages of a 1959 edition of TIME Magazine. Although the map’s aesthetic style suggests a sense of lightheartedness, the graphics depict some quite frightening developments of the Cold War and Space Race; we see Khrushchev raising a fist toward Europe, various political leaders facing off, references to atomic explosions in parts of Russia and the United States, and oversized space crafts circling the globe.

The projection choice of this map is particularly clever.
