### Article Title

2021 was a busy year for the Map Center! We welcomed tens of thousands of visitors to our [digital](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/) and in-person Bending Lines exhibition, engaged with over 150 K-12 educators, introduced new faces to our team, and brought 85 new physical materials into our [collection](https://www.leventhalmap.org/collections/).

These new acquisitions range from early depictions of New England to original maps created by underrepresented cartographers in the twentieth century. Our active acquisition program allows us to diversify the voices in our collection, support researchers’ interests, and enhance our exhibitions and programs.
