### 2021 Acquisition Roundup!

2021 was a busy year for the Map Center! We welcomed tens of thousands of visitors to our [digital](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/) and in-person Bending Lines exhibition, engaged with over 150 K-12 educators, introduced new faces to our team, and brought 85 new physical materials into our [collection](https://www.leventhalmap.org/collections/).

These new acquisitions range from early depictions of New England to original maps created by underrepresented cartographers in the twentieth century. Our active acquisition program allows us to diversify the voices in our collection, support researchers’ interests, and enhance our exhibitions and programs.

> The 85 new additions to the LMEC collection span from **1548 to 2020** and range from early depictions of New England to original maps created by underrepresented cartographers in the twentieth century. Let's take a closer look at a few. Which is your favorite?

#### More or Less in Common

As we move into 2022, we are thrilled to open our forthcoming exhibition [More or Less in Common](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/environmental-justice-exhibition-preview/), a show that will explore the geographic relationship between environmental management and historic patterns of injustice.

The exhibition is timed to coincide with the bicentennial anniversary of one of Boston’s most influential environmental planners, the landscape architect **Frederick Law Olmsted**. Olmsted’s famous [Emerald Necklace](https://www.emeraldnecklace.org/) forms (in some places) the dividing line between communities that are amongst the richest in the country and others that are languishing in poverty.

As Boston’s Back Bay developed in the late-19th century, residents complained of “[sewage outfalls](https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/back-bay-fens)”, a “[stagnant saltwater marsh that flooded and threatened public health](https://www.emeraldnecklace.org/park-overview/back-bay-fens/),” and “[a foul-smelling tidal creek and swamp](https://www.emeraldnecklace.org/park-overview/back-bay-fens/).” In 1878, Olmsted proposed a plan to address these concerns, maintain the “[character](https://www.boston.gov/parks/back-bay-fens)” of the terrain, and meet the [needs](https://www.boston.gov/parks/back-bay-fens) of the surrounding community through dual sanitation and recreation solutions.

This 1880 [map](https://airtable.com/shr0RgG4AfpROgnqH/tbl8n5HBE6rTSSiap/viwvcR4MTOqT8GAnT/recg7pZ8Toq0V8U86?backgroundColor=green&viewControls=on) was published by the Boston Park Department and displays a manuscript plan of Olmsted's proposed [Back Bay Park](https://www.tclf.org/landscapes/back-bay-fens). Although the park was [modified](https://www.asla.org/guide/site.aspx?id=40840) by 1910 construction of the Charles River Dam, Back Bay Fens includes an “[eclectic mix of formal and community gardens, ball fields, memorials and historic structures](https://www.emeraldnecklace.org/park-overview/back-bay-fens/).”

More information on **More or Less in Common** coming soon!

#### A Global Health Emergency

During recent years, public health has maintained a foregrounded position in global media, conversations within households, and space in mental real estate. This pictorial [map](https://airtable.com/shr0RgG4AfpROgnqH/tbl8n5HBE6rTSSiap/viwvcR4MTOqT8GAnT/recJJHUjpbBcKUpmM?backgroundColor=green&viewControls=on) from 1944 contextualizes a series of **public health crises** from a more distant past.

{{< figure src="/uploads/2021-12-29/major-tropical-disease.jpeg" caption="Boris Artzybasheff, “[World map of the major tropical diseases: LIFE map by Artzybasheff](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8038086),” (\[Chicago, Illinois\]: Life, \[1944\])." class="figure-left" >}}

The base of the map includes brief descriptions of **15 diseases**, including malaria, yellow fever, dengue, typhus, plague, cholera, sleeping sickness, tularemia, Rocky Mountain fever, Japanese river fever, relapsing fever, helminthic disease, yaws, leprosy, and leishmaniasis, each accompanied by a pictorial form of their respective vector.

This aesthetic choice––to sprawl countless “[insects, pests, and deformed humans”](https://hist1952.omeka.fas.harvard.edu/exhibits/show/galleriesmain/item/184) across the global landscape––forms a visual message of **alarm and urgency.**

#### Folklore (Gropper's Version)

Taylor Swift’s [Folklore](https://g.co/kgs/jcZGEi) was one of the biggest albums of 2020, and William Gropper’s “[America, Its Folklore](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8038083)” is one of our favorite finds from 2021. Like Swift's album, Gropper’s map has tricky history of trust, betrayal, and misunderstanding.

During **World War II**, Gropper worked with the [U.S. Treasury Department and the White House’s Office of War Information](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/william-gropper-map-american-folklore) to present “[specific war information objectives](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/william-gropper-map-american-folklore)” in pictorial form on propaganda materials. Gropper was recognized and praised for his contributions, and included in the [State Department’s Overseas Library Program](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/william-gropper-map-american-folklore) from 1946 to 1953; as part of the program, over **1,700 copies** of his 1946 [map](https://airtable.com/shr0RgG4AfpROgnqH/tbl8n5HBE6rTSSiap/viwvcR4MTOqT8GAnT/recq14F6oHZxc9SHu?backgroundColor=green&viewControls=on) were distributed to libraries across the globe.

{{< figure src="/uploads/2021-12-29/folklore.jpeg" caption="William Gropper, “[William Gropper’s America, its folklore](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8038083),” (\[New York\]: \[Associated American Artists\], 1946)." class="figure-right" >}}

Upon first glance, the map paints a whimsical portrayal of **American folklore**, highlighting the figures of Paul Bunyan, Johnny Appleseed, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Huck Finn, and many, many more. Within these figures, the State Department saw an opportunity to promote the United States as a “[fun-loving, welcoming, and, most important, free land](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/william-gropper-map-american-folklore).”

During the early 1950s, Roy Cohn––the chief counsel to **Senator Joseph McCarthy**––visited many libraries included in the Overseas Library Program and identified Gropper as a “[fringe \[supporter\] and \[sympathizer\]](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/william-gropper-map-american-folklore)” and his work as “[Communist-directed.](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/william-gropper-map-american-folklore)” Although Gropper was not actually a Communist, his map was declared "[un-American](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/william-gropper-map-american-folklore)" and consequently destroyed. Just a few existing copies remain today.

#### An Interesting World in an Interesting Time

May you live in an interesting world in an interesting time!

{{< figure src="/uploads/2021-12-29/its-an-interesting-world.jpeg" caption="R. M. Chapin Jr., “[It’s an interesting world in an interesting time / TIME map by R.M. Chapin, Jr. and J. Donovan; Time, Inc.](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S75C8079826),” (\[New York\] : Time Inc., \[1959\])." class="figure-right" >}}

This cartoony [poster](https://airtable.com/shr0RgG4AfpROgnqH/tbl8n5HBE6rTSSiap/viwvcR4MTOqT8GAnT/recZS2uYv6DWgSBv2/fldDSJdHNjEAkI8qP/atttRfsIzlTZNxlVj?backgroundColor=green&viewControls=on) comes right from the pages of a 1959 edition of **TIME Magazine**. Although the map’s aesthetic style suggests a sense of lightheartedness, the graphics depict some quite frightening developments of the **Cold War** and **Space Race**; we see Khrushchev raising a fist toward Europe, various political leaders facing off, references to atomic explosions in parts of Russia and the United States, and oversized space crafts circling the globe.

The projection choice of this map is particularly fitting. Created in [1943](https://www.wired.com/2014/01/projection-raisz-armadillo/) by Hungarian cartographer Erwin Raisz, the **armadillo projection** attempts to display a map with the “[lively look of a globe](https://www.wired.com/2014/01/projection-raisz-armadillo/),” that is, to make a “[flat map... look 3-dimensional](https://www.wired.com/2014/01/projection-raisz-armadillo/).” As placed within the context of the year 1959, the projection allows for a display of all critical world events, both on the surface of the Earth and in the atmosphere of space.

#### Supply Chain Woes & Foes
