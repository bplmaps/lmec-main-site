Today's entry in the [#30DayMapChallenge](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Abplmaps%20%2330DayMapChallenge) is "boundary," and we certainly live in a part of the world that is full of bizarre and twisting boundaries. European colonists ran arbitrary lines of political division through territories about which they knew almost nothing, inserting geographic placeholders for areas in areas of future expansion, ignoring Native settlement and often setting up future conflicts over ambiguous territorial definitions.

The colonial charter for Massachusetts Bay set its northern boundary in relationship to the Merrimack River, at a time when the English didn't realize that the river's course turns north from its east-west orientation about 40 miles inland, running deep into what is now New Hampshire.

When the Merrimack River's course was finally better understood by Europeans, the grantees of the New Hampshire colony protested against Massachusetts claiming territory so far north. In 1740, King George II decreed that Massachusetts's northern border would follow a three mile arc around the Merrimack, until reaching "a point due north of Pawtucket Falls" in what is now Lowell.

But where was that, exactly? The surveyor George Mitchell was sent to find out, and, in 1741, produced a [map that appears in our collections](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:hx11z5730).
