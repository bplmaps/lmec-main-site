A birthday celebration is in order! Frederick Law Olmsted was born on this day in 1822 in Hartford, CT. Today, he is remembered as the founder of landscape architecture and celebrated for his contributions to landscapes across the country. For those in Boston, we have Olmsted to thank for many of the city’s most widely-used green spaces, including Back Bay Fens, the Riverway, Olmsted Park, Jamaica Pond, the Arnold Arboretum, Franklin Park, and many more.

Created in 1900, this map shows the locations of trees, shrubs, and pathways in Arnold Arboretum. Arnold Arboretum’s design was the result of a collaboration between Frederick Law Olmsted and amateur horticulturalist Charles Sargent. Situated on the former site of the Bussey family farm, the Arboretum was established in 1872 with the bequest of James Arnold, a New Bedford whaling merchant. In 1882, Harvard and the City of Boston reached a unique arrangement: Harvard transferred the Arboretum’s land to the City as part of its public park system and in turn, the City leased the property to Harvard for a thousand years, leaving control of the collections with Arboretum staff.
