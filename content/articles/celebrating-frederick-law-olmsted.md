A birthday celebration is in order! Frederick Law Olmsted was born on this day in 1822 in Hartford, CT. Today, he is remembered as the founder of landscape architecture and celebrated for his contributions to landscapes across the country. For those in Boston, we have Olmsted to thank for many of the city’s most widely-used green spaces, including Back Bay Fens, the Riverway, Olmsted Park, Jamaica Pond, the Arnold Arboretum, Franklin Park, and many more. 

Our current exhibition, [More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/), has been timed to coincide with this bicentennial anniversary. Let's take a closer look at a few maps from our current exhibition and in our digital collections that document Olmsted's projects in Boston. 

The 1877 [map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:js956k89q) below shows an early plan for Back Bay Park, what we now call Back Bay Fens. The blue lines trace out the winding routes of the Muddy River’s former delta. The attached newspaper advertisement notes an 1878 competition “for the best Plan for laying out the Back Bay Park.” The winning entry was simply a plan for a formal flower garden, which the Parks Department discarded, calling instead on the skills of the visionary landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Olmsted’s eventual design for the park system called for a naturalistic style that echoed Romantic era ideals of bringing the countryside into the city.

It includes formal and community gardens, ball fields, memorials and historic structures." class="figure-center" >}}

Created in 1900, the [map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161f59c) below shows the locations of trees, shrubs, and pathways in Arnold Arboretum. Arnold Arboretum’s design was the result of a collaboration between Frederick Law Olmsted and amateur horticulturalist Charles Sargent. Situated on the former site of the Bussey family farm, the Arboretum was established in 1872 with the bequest of James Arnold, a New Bedford whaling merchant. In 1882, Harvard and the City of Boston reached a unique arrangement: Harvard transferred the Arboretum’s land to the City as part of its public park system and in turn, the City leased the property to Harvard for a thousand years, leaving control of the collections with Arboretum staff.
