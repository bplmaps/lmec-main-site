> *On August 16, we hosted **From The Vault: The Making of Maps**.*\
> \
> “Cartography,” the practice of creating and studying maps, has evolved greatly over the last several thousand years alongside humans. As our understanding of the world around us has shifted, so too have the ways in which we are able to represent the world we've come to know. Throughout this process, countless different techniques have been utilized across many different cultures and time periods to be able to most accurately represent what we see around us. What did these processes look like, and which have ultimately proven to stand the test of time? We asked visitors to decide for themselves during “The Making of Maps” From The Vault! 

### Engraving (Woodcut Print) 

##### Ptolemy, active 2nd century, Hol, Lienhart, and Johannes Schnitzer ***[The world](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462s124)*** (1482)

“The World,” is based on manuscripts from the Greek geographer and mathematician Ptolmey and provides a detailed look into what the ancient Greeks believed the Earth to be. Despite the original 2nd century manuscript of Ptolemy being destroyed, copies of these manuscripts existed in the 15th century around the same time as the popularity of the printing press exploded. This led Ptolemy’s “World” to be one of the first geographical texts ever engraved and printed. 

Engraving is one of the first known methods of mapmaking on a larger commercial scale, and at this time was primarily done with wooden blocks in a method known as “woodcut.” This process involved carving away material from a wooden block to leave a raised image behind. The printers would then apply ink to the raised sections of the block, avoiding the carved out recesses, and imprint the ink onto paper; similar to how a stamp works. Oftentimes, the ink used for printing would leave a raised texture on top of the paper.

### Etching 

##### George Hartnell Bartlett [The public libraries of Massachusetts](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd3761121) (1904)

This map is a 1904 pictorial demonstration of the different public libraries across the state of Massachusetts designed through a process called etching. Etching is another printing technique developed about 100 years after woodcut engraving that allowed map makers and artists to add significantly more detail into their pieces. Similarly to engraving, etching involves carving a design into a plate and then pressing that plate onto a piece of paper. 

The differences between the two lie in the process of creating the plate. Instead of carving away material from a wooden block, etching relied on covering a piece of metal in an acid-resistant material, drawing the desired design on the plate, and then dipping the plate into an acid bath to eat away at the drawn-on metal not covered by the initial coating. Afterwards, the plate is inked, and the ink is placed into the recesses of the plate as opposed to on top of the raised reliefs. It is then pressed onto a piece of paper to complete the printing process.

##### Joseph Frederick Wallet Des Barres [A view of Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:7h149z72h) (1779)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:7h149z73s/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" caption="" >}}

This is a 1779 bird’s eye view of Boston’s harbor intended to be used as a visual guide for visiting captains and crews that pairs alongside nautical maps. The method utilized to create this print is referred to as “aquatint.” Most often used in tandem with etching, the aquatint method leaves the acid resistant resin on specific areas of the plate for different periods of time, allowing for the acid to eat away at certain parts of the plate more than others. Because of this process, when the plate is later inked, specific sections can hold more ink than others, thus creating darker or lighter tones. 

The development of etching and later aquatint allowed for the creation of significantly more complex designs in the printing and cartographic worlds due to the complexity of lines one could now create. Though designs could now be more complex, they were also getting increasingly more difficult and expensive to make due to the new range of materials needed for the process.

### Hand Coloring 

##### Japan. Rikugun. Sanbō Honbu. [Ajia Tōbu Yochizu](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161j212) (1875)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161j22b/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

This 1875 military map of Japan was used by the government to refer to the population of the major cities across the country. Similarly to other maps shown today, it was created through the etching process—this piece was etched on a copper plate. Different from the other maps shown, this map has distinctive color running along the borders of each land mass. While Ptolemy’s world map was printed in color, the application appears somewhat crude as it was printed directly onto paper from the woodcut block. 

In this Japanese map, a process known as “hand coloring” was utilized. Most maps before the 1800s were printed entirely in black and white, and had the option to be ‘colored’ as an upgrade. The hired “colorists” would source different pigments from across the globe, and carefully paint them onto the maps in faint washes to achieve the look their client requested. Most commonly, the borders of countries were colored for ease of use of the map later on, but many maps were lavishly decorated, making them beautifully painted art pieces in their own right.

##### Andreas Cellarius [Planisphaerium Ptolemaicum siue machina orbium mundi ex hypothesi Ptolemaica in plano disposita](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f9294) (1661)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x633f930w/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

This stunningly colored celestial map from 1661 brings together the theories of many famous astronomers such as Ptolemy and Copernicus about the stars, the Sun and Moon, and the different planets in our galaxy. It is a beautiful depiction of the sheer breadth of coloring that could be achieved on maps and how colring was used both to emphasize the practicality and readability of the map as well as to present the map as a piece of art. With this map, a combination of techniques was utilized to give it its distinctive color palette. The engraving plates used to print this map held some color as it was printed, then a colorist later went on to add more depth to the piece. 

Note how the color of this map is still so vibrant despite being nearly 400 years old. The artists responsible for coloring maps took great care to mix their pigments with different compounds that would not only maintain the integrity of the paper, but would also stay as vibrant and vivid as possible for as long as possible. With all the care taken to hand color maps and all the beauty it could achieve, the process was extremely expensive and few could afford pieces as intricate and colorful as these. 

##### J.R. Silva ***[Mapa Humoristico da Europa em 1953](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:23168261)*** (1953)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/PJM_2371_01.jpg" class="" >}}

Created in the 1950s, this rare satirical European war map is said to be “out of its time” as it dramatically portrays the Iron Curtain at the height of the Cold War where many maps of this genre were produced before 1916. With its use of caricature and humor to comment on the tense political climate, the division between the Western and Eastern worlds is made clear. The Portuguese cartographers emphasized the absurdity of the world by portraying countries with exaggerated stereotypes, leaving viewers to think about what the fears and perceptions of the time are.

##### F. Klimesch [***Was von der Entente übrig bliebe wenn sie Ernst machte mit dem Selbstbestimmungsrecht iher eigenen Völker und die Zügel losliesse!*** = What would remain of the Entente if it took seriously the 'self-determination right' of its own nations and let go of the reins!](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:3293853) (1918)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/PJM_1197_01.jpg" class="" >}}

In light of President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Point Plan and the entrance of the United States into World War I, this 1917 German persuasive map mocks the Allied powers’ control over their colonies. The map features caricatures of the global powers, each holding reins tied to the lands they had colonized, symbolizing the tight grip they have on their reluctance to grant true self-determination to their territories. This imagery underscores the hypocrisy of the allies’ advocacy for self-determination—a principle that they are pushing onto Germany—versus their actual practices of maintaining control.
