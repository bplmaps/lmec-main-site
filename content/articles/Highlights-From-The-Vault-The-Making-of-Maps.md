> “Cartography,” the practice of creating and studying maps, has evolved greatly over the last several thousand years alongside humans. As our understanding of the world around us has shifted, so too have the ways in which we are able to represent the world we've come to know. Throughout this process, countless different techniques have been utilized across many different cultures and time periods to be able to most accurately represent what we see around us. What did these processes look like, and which have ultimately proven to stand the test of time? We asked visitors to decide for themselves during “The Making of Maps” From The Vault! 

##### Ptolemy, active 2nd century, Hol, Lienhart, and Johannes Schnitzer [The world](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f462s124) (1482)

“The World,” is based on manuscripts from the Greek geographer and mathematician Ptolmey and provides a detailed look into what the ancient Greeks believed the Earth to be. Despite the original 2nd century manuscript of Ptolemy being destroyed, copies of these manuscripts existed in the 15th century around the same time as the popularity of the printing press exploded. This led Ptolemy’s “World” to be one of the first geographical texts ever engraved and printed. 


Engraving is one of the first known methods of mapmaking on a larger commercial scale, and at this time was primarily done with wooden blocks in a method known as “woodcut.” This process involved carving away material from a wooden block to leave a raised image behind. The printers would then apply ink to the raised sections of the block, avoiding the carved out recesses, and imprint the ink onto paper; similar to how a stamp works. Oftentimes, the ink used for printing would leave a raised texture on top of the paper. 

##### Frederic W. Rose ***[Serio-comic war map for the year 1877](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fk80z)*** (1877)

The motif of the octopus frequents propaganda beginning in the 19th century, depicting countries as grotesque tentacled beasts grasping at land. Falling under the umbrella of satirical maps, this 1887 serio-comic war map charts the political climate in Europe during the Russo-Turkish war, a conflict between the declining Ottoman Empire and the Russians, seeking to expand and regain lost territory. With tentacles encasing Crimea, encircling the Black sea, and ensnaring the Turks, this map negatively reflects Russia’s desire for expansion. By portraying the remaining countries as human, British cartographer F.W. Rose alienates Russia; viewers of the map feel disconnected from the many-armed octopus, therefore making it easier to fear and hate the Russians.

##### Kisaburō Ohara ***[A humorous diplomatic atlas of Europe and Asia](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9s161c15w)*** (1904)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:9s161c165/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="" >}}

Mirroring much of the imagery in some of the other maps shown, this satirical map of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) was directly inspired by F.W. Rose and the idea of Russia as the “black octopus.” Though one originates from England and the other from Japan, both share similarities in the monstrous portrayal of Russia and the dynamic interactions of other countries. Ohara, however, expands further into Asia to many more countries, most notably Korea and Manchuria—areas that both Japanese and Russian imperial powers wished to control. The map’s pro-Japanese sentiment can be seen in its characterization of Japan as a soldier, free from the tentacles of the octopus and boldly facing its enemies with flag and weapon in hand.

##### Tsan Tai Tse and Dechen Liu [***Shíjú tú*** = Map of current situation in East Asia](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:xw42qq877) (1946–1950)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:d217t652r/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Early 1950s China was on the brink of massive reforms like the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, and the Chinese Communist Party utilized propaganda to fuel growing nationalism and Mao Zedong’s cult of personality. Prowling predators representing outside powers roam across this map, encroaching on China’s land and illustrating the threats of capitalism and imperialism in what its title refers to as the “current situation.” The rising sun symbol of imperial Japan reaches towards a figure while the American eagle soars below and the British lion patrols along the coast, reminding all of the disgrace of the Opium Wars and China’s century of humiliation.

##### Eugen von Baumgarten ***[L'Entente Cordiale 1915](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:19343435)*** (1915)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/PJM_2097_01.jpg" >}}

In an attempt to reinforce the German propaganda aimed at mocking British expansionism, this 1915 persuasive map made by the Germans satirically critiques the Anglo-French alliance established by their 1904 Cordial Agreement. The cartographer’s decision to cast Great Britain as a spider with its webs extending all over France, North Africa, and even the United States in the background, reflects German criticism of Great Britain’s imperial ambitions as the principle cause of the war, getting nations in its web of influence to fight on its behalf. 

How does this depiction shape our understanding of the geopolitical tensions of World War I?

##### J.R. Silva ***[Mapa Humoristico da Europa em 1953](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:23168261)*** (1953)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/PJM_2371_01.jpg" class="" >}}

Created in the 1950s, this rare satirical European war map is said to be “out of its time” as it dramatically portrays the Iron Curtain at the height of the Cold War where many maps of this genre were produced before 1916. With its use of caricature and humor to comment on the tense political climate, the division between the Western and Eastern worlds is made clear. The Portuguese cartographers emphasized the absurdity of the world by portraying countries with exaggerated stereotypes, leaving viewers to think about what the fears and perceptions of the time are.

##### F. Klimesch [***Was von der Entente übrig bliebe wenn sie Ernst machte mit dem Selbstbestimmungsrecht iher eigenen Völker und die Zügel losliesse!*** = What would remain of the Entente if it took seriously the 'self-determination right' of its own nations and let go of the reins!](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/catalog/ss:3293853) (1918)

{{< figure src="https://assets.tina.io/097f9d05-d307-4978-823b-d332ea55d27e/PJM_1197_01.jpg" class="" >}}

In light of President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Point Plan and the entrance of the United States into World War I, this 1917 German persuasive map mocks the Allied powers’ control over their colonies. The map features caricatures of the global powers, each holding reins tied to the lands they had colonized, symbolizing the tight grip they have on their reluctance to grant true self-determination to their territories. This imagery underscores the hypocrisy of the allies’ advocacy for self-determination—a principle that they are pushing onto Germany—versus their actual practices of maintaining control.
