> On April 28, we hosted [From The Vault: The Great Outdoors](https://www.leventhalmap.org/event/from-the-vault-collections-showing-the-great-outdoors/)! From The Vault is a biweekly collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. For this edition of From The Vault, we took a look at objects that map National Parks, green space around Boston, and the natural world beyond.
