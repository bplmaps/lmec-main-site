> *On December 20, we hosted **From The Vault: LMEC Community — Best Maps of 2024.***

If you’ve ever wondered which of our maps are the most popular with visitors and researchers, here’s your chance!

At the LMEC, we have over a quarter million maps in our collection and more than 14,000 digitized and available through our digital collection portal. We’ve run the numbers and in this From the Vault, we’re here to show you some of our most popular maps of the last year! There are some maps that remain ever popular, but there are certainly some maps that may surprise you. See if you can guess which was the most viewed!

#### Russian War Relief, Inc.; E. Means [38,000,000 escaped -- 10,000,000 died](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm228) \[ca. 1940–1949]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:0r96fm23j/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Offering up a unique perspective, [this speculative map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fm228) uses a familiar view of the United States to help put the devastation of World War 2 in Russia into a more understandable context for Americans. American cities are given equivalent Russian counterparts and the statement at the bottom pleads for Americans to empathize with the amount of damage caused to the country and its people.

Created by the Russian War Relief, Incorporated and headquartered in New York City, this was an attempt to appeal to the American people to “help keep relief ships sailing” to Russia in their time of need.

#### William Phineas Upham, [Map of Salem Village 1692](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x059cb88s) (1866)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:x059cb892/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x059cb88s) depicts the village and town center of Salem as it was during the year of the infamous Witch Trials in 1692. Important sites are also highlighted including the “Witch House” and the court house where the witches were tried and found guilty. Though no convicted “witches” were burned at the stake in Salem, as often thought, more than 25 victims were killed because of the accusations. 

#### Joseph Husson, Jr., [Map of a Woman’s Heart](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kr20j) \[1840–1860]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:cj82kr21t/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Illustrating the mysterious land of a woman’s heart, [this map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82kr20j) is a comical take on the different facets of love and relationships. Centered on the Ocean of Love, Ideal Isle is disconnected from the rest of the land but just a quick hop from Cape Hope. An arrow (maybe one of Cupid’s?) has pierced the Devotion region of the heart. We can also see the lands Curiosity, Pride, and Hatred and some interesting geographic features, like Mt. Fashion and the Rocks of Despair. 

#### Justin Winsor, [Boston old and new](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f8662) (1880)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:8k71nt56d/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Noted historian and librarian, Justin Winsor created [this unique map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f8662) by superimposing the outline of the original Shawmut Peninsula onto an 1880 map of Boston. It was used as the beginning piece for the first volume of his "Memorial History of Boston, Including Suffolk County, Massachusetts", published in 1882. Though drawn without the assistance of computers or aerial photographs, it remains one of the most vivid diagrams of the radical transformation and enlargement of the Shawmut Peninsula area during the 19th century.

#### Currier & Ives, [The true issue or "thats whats the matter"](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fk27g) (1864)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:q524nj00d/full/1200,/0/default.jpg" >}}

A political cartoon issued shortly after the Democratic Party's nomination of George Brinton McClellan as their Presidential nominee in the election of 1864. [The cartoon](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4m90fk27g) depicts McClellan as the peace candidate. Crying "The Union must be preserved at all hazards!", McClellan attempts to reconcile Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis who are fighting over a large map of the United States with a tear down the center. 

Pulling at the Northern side of the map, Lincoln declares, "No peace without Abolition!" Grasping the Southern side of the map, Davis retorts, "No peace without Separation!!" This image, incorporating both caricature and map elements, depicts the significance of the Civil War in American history. The regional tensions of the 1840s and 1850s led to the secession of eleven southern states to form the Confederate States of America and four years of the bloodiest war in American history.

#### John F. Waite, ***[Uncle Sam’s Family Tree](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463673h)*** (1900)

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:3f463674s/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" class="" >}}

Created as an advertisement for Arbuckles, a wholesale grocer, the territorial growth of the United States is compared to an orchard tree. Printed on the backhand side of a United States map, [this unusual graphic](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f463673h) is essentially a geographical timeline, charting the chronological growth of the nation.

In representing the United States, the cartographer uses a tree that sits in “the great American garden” and is tended by “Uncle Sam”, a common national personification of the federal government of the United States. The roots symbolize the original thirteen colonies, while subsequent “grafts” and branches represent other states and occupied territories added by war, purchase, and annexation.

#### Gerard Valck, ***[Novus Planiglobii Terrestris per Utrumque Polum Conspectus](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f9162)*** \[1695?]

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:qb98n774z/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" >}}

While most double hemisphere maps display the world divided into eastern and western hemispheres, a more unusual portrayal uses the northern and southern hemispheres. Gerard Valck’s [ornately decorated map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:x633f9162) exemplifies a polar-oriented projection.

The two spheres, adorned with ships and a symmetrical arrangement of compass roses, are set against an artistic backdrop highlighting the Genesis story of creation. At the top is a dramatic presentation of the sun, moon, and stars emerging from clouds of darkness. Other vignettes depict Adam and Eve leaving the Garden of Eden, and Noah selecting pairs of animals for the ark.
