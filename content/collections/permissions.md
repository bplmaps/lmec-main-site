## Rights to digital images

High-resolution imagery for most maps and objects in our [Digital Collections](/collections/digital-collections) is available for download directly from each object's record page in TIFF and JPEG format. Unless otherwise noted, all images are in the public domain and have no restrictions on use. We provide no warranty as to the copyright status of the objects themselves.

Maps from partner institutions are not available for download or reproduction through our Digital Collections portal. Contact the holding institution for permissions and reproductions.

## Attribution and credit

If you reproduce an object from our collections in your own work, please credit both the Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library for the image and, if the "Collection" field indicates a partner institution, that institution's name as well.

We appreciate notification when you use our images in your own work, whether a teaching slideshow or a scholarly monograph, so that we can track usage. Please email our [Reference & Cataloging Librarian](/about/people/lauren-chen/) to let us know if our images have been useful to you.

Should the image(s) appear in a print publication, please send one copy to the Center to be added to the collection. [Visit the Contact & Connect page](/about/contact-connect) for mailing information.
