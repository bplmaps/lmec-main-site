## Rights to digital images

High-resolution imagery for most maps and objects in our [Digital Collections](/collections/digital-collections) is available for download directly from each object's record page in TIFF and JPEG format. Unless otherwise noted, all images are in the public domain and have no restrictions on use. We provide no warranty as to the copyright status of the objects themselves.

Maps from partner institutions are not available for download or reproduction through our Digital Collections portal. Contact the holding institution for permissions and reproductions.

## Attribution and credit

#### Reproducing an object from our collections

If you reproduce an object from our collections in your own work, please credit both the Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library for the image and, if the "Collection" field indicates a partner institution, that institution's name as well.

**Examples**

> Reproduction courtesy of the Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library

We appreciate notification when you use our images in your own work, whether a teaching slideshow or a scholarly monograph, so that we can track usage. Please email our [Reference & Cataloging Librarian](/about/people/lauren-chen/) to let us know if our images have been useful to you.

Should the image(s) appear in a print publication, please send one copy to the Center to be added to the collection. [Visit the Contact & Connect page](/about/contact-connect) for mailing information.

#### Citations to Atlascope and atlas layers

The Leventhal Map & Education Center's [Atlascope tool](https://atlascope.org) makes it easy to examine how towns and cities in Massachusetts have changed over the last 150 years.

To cite a particular atlas layer that you discovered in Atlascope, click on the "Bibliographic information" button inside the "Atlases" drawer at the bottom of the screen. This will open a pane that displays bibliographic details for the layer currently in the viewport, as well as a link back to the object record in LMEC digital collections. For example, to cite [this view](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-71.07733,42.34963$zoom:18.00$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/al7rtfm98) of a 1902 Bromley atlas:

> Bromley, George Washington. *Atlas of the City of Boston : Boston proper and Back Bay*. Boston, MA: G.W. Bromley & Co, 1902. From Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library. Accessed 21 November, 2023 via https://atlascope.org.

To reference the Atlascope application itself, please cite:

Please contact our [Assistant Curator for Digital & Participatory Geography](/about/people/ian-spangler) to let us know if you've found Atlascope helpful or used it as part of a physical or digital publication.
