An archival collection is a group of related materials that documents the activities of an individual, family, or organization. The Leventhal Map & Education Center's archival collections include personal papers of cartographers, records of mapping or surveying firms, and subject-based collections. Archives at LMEC are described in finding aids, which include essential information about the creation, content, arrangement, and context of these collections.
