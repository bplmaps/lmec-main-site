### Cartography Challenge

Four times each year, the Leventhal Map & Education Center hosts a Cartography Challenge. We invite mapmakers, cartographers, designers, and anyone who. Submissions are evaluated by a combination of Map Center staff and guest judges, according to that submission cycle's criteria.

The rules are simple: we provide the **Topic**, the **Dataset(s)**, and the **Challenge**. Submissions should be high-resolution maps (>=300 DPI) that respond to each of these criteria. The data for each Cartography Challenge can be downloaded for free from our [Data Portal](https://data.leventhalmap.org).

In addition to receiving a $200 honorarium and being featured in the Map Center's digital exhibition, winners will have their work formally accessioned into the Center's digital collections portal under a Creative Commons license. While we can only make one monetary award per submission cycle, we are happy to display and accession honorary mentions into our digital collections and exhibitions.

There is no expectation that maps be made using a particular software or program, but maps must ultimately be submitted as static images. **Web maps will not be considered for this Cartography Challenge**.

#### The Topic: Immigration in Greater Boston

Right now, the Map Center has relatively few maps that depict immigration in the Greater Boston region. Most of them are cut and dry choropleth maps that depict the density of foreign-born population in a given area. "Greater Boston" can be interpreted flexibly.

#### The Data: 2020 American Community Survey: 5-year (2016-2020)

<!-- {{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:h989r708n/full/pct:5/0/default.jpg" alt="Boston neighborhoods by foreign-born population" caption="[This map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:h989r707c) proportionally represents the countries of origin for foreign-born populations by neighborhood in Boston." class="figure-right" >}} -->

The 2020 Census brought us a wealth of new data, including data on immigration in the US. This Cartography Challenge focuses on foreign-born population data at the Census tract level from the American Community Survey's (ACS) 5-year estimates from 2016-2020. After downloading this data from [NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/), we did some light processing to clarify field names and types. For the most 

To get started with the data, [download it from our Data Portal](https://data.leventhalmap.org) for free. Applicants need not limit their submission to *only* this dataset, and submissions are welcome to include additional data such as other Census tables or user-generated data. At minimum, though, submissions must include the 2016-2020 ACS 5-year estimates for foreign-born population.

#### The Challenge: No Choropleth, No Problem

In our inaugural **Cartography Challenge**, we're looking for submissions that go beyond the choropleth map. While useful for visualizing differences across space, choropleth maps can [be especially misleading when it comes to data representation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-25/how-to-avoid-being-fooled-by-bad-maps). At the Map Center, almost all of the immigration maps in our collections represent data through choropleth maps. We need a break from them, so for now, we're putting an embargo on choropleth.

Before you ask: yes, this embargo extends to [bivariate maps](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/bivariate-choropleth).

We want to see maps that tell a story, maps that move and that move us. We're excited about submissions that creatively and elegantly visualize the source dataset in unexpected ways. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about what counts and what doesn't.

#### Evaluation rubric

Submissions will be evaluated according to these five criteria:
* **Visual creativity**. Does the submission explore ?
* **Data creativity.** Does the submission meet ...
* **Educational capacity.** Is the submission visually engaging for both young learners and for adults? Can it be fruitfully used in teaching and public education?
* **Design.** Does the submission follow good design principles? Does the submission follow best practices in accessible design, accounting for colorblind and other visually-impaired map readers?

#### Eligibility

We invite submissions from cartographers, mapmakers, and designers working in visual media, including illustrators, graphic designers, data scientists, and others who emphasize the geographic dimension of their practice.

Special consideration will be given to applicants who belong to communities that have been historically excluded from the cartographic and design professions. 

#### To Apply

<a href="" class="btn btn-md btn-outline-primary">Online application</a>

An application consists of the following material submitted by **November 11, 2022 at 10pm ET**:

* A map at 300 DPI that appropriately responds to the present submission cycle's topic, data, and challenge themes (uploads or URLs in TIFF format)
* A technical statement of not more than 500 words describing the workflow used to create the map (if not already present in the map)
* A data bibliography (if not already present in the map)
* An indication of whether you would like your submission to be considered for accession into the [LMEC's Digital Collections](https://collections.leventhalmap.org) and licensed under a Creative Commons copyright

Successful applicants will be notified by December 11, 2022.
