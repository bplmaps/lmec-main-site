## Newly acquired objects 

This database lists the objects most recently added to our collections. For more information about an object, click the "Catalog Record" button. This table may not show the fully authoritative bibliographic information for items, and may include items which are still being processed and not yet available to patrons. The images in this database are for identifying purposes only, and do not represent the archival-quality images in our [Digital Collections](/collections/digital-collections).

To make an appointment to see a recently acquired object, [see our research appointments page](/research/appointments).

## Services for Collectors and Dealers

The Map Center typically does not accept unsolicited bids for the purchase of new objects. If you have a collection of maps or other geographic material that you would like to donate to our permanent collections, please [contact us](/about/contact) to set up a discussion.

As a matter of policy, the Map Center does not offer appraisal or evaluation services for collectors. You can find a [list of dealers at MapRecord](https://www.maprecord.com/Dealers.html) as well as a [list of conservators from the American Institute for Conservation](https://www.culturalheritage.org/about-conservation/find-a-conservator). If you would like to find examples of similar objects from your own collection that exist in our collections, please [make a research appointment](/research).
