## Using the digital collections

The Leventhal Map & Education Center has one of the most significant digital collections of any North American map library.

### Digital repositories

Our materials are mainly available on two online repositories, both of which are free to access without registration.

* **Digital Collections portal.** Nearly 10,000 objects, primarily flat maps but also including some bound atlases, ephemera, and series, are available on our [Digital Collections portal](https://collections.leventhalmap.org). The Digital Collections portal features an [advanced search](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/advanced) for filtering material by date and theme, as well as many maps that have been [georeferenced](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?f%5Bgeoreferenced_bsi%5D%5B%5D=yes) for display on top of a modern map layer. <a href="https://collections.leventhalmap.org/" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-xs mr-2"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Go to the Digital Collections portal</a>
* **Internet Archive.** Over 300 atlases and books, consisting of bound format, non-oversize materials, are scanned and uploaded to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/normanbleventhalmapcenter). <a href="https://archive.org/details/normanbleventhalmapcenter" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-xs mr-2"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Go to the Internet Archive collection</a>

### Other digital discovery tools

* **Atlascope.** The [Atlascope project](projects/digital-projects/#atlascope) involves the digital transformation of over a hundred fire insurance and real estate atlases of Boston and its inner suburbs, showing detail down to the parcel and building level for a period from 1860â€“1940. <a href="https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-xs mr-2"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Go to the Atlascope web app</a>
* **Digital Commonwealth.** Our Digital Collections portal is part of [Digital Commonwealth](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org), a consortium of more than 180 cultural heritage organizations across Massachusetts. From the Digital Commonwealth repository, you can search Map Center collections together with maps, images, texts, sound records, and millions of other objects from other institutions. <a href="https://digitalcommonwealth.org" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-xs mr-2"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Go to the Digital Commonwealth portal</a>
* **Flickr.** Before the development of our Digital Collections portal, we uploaded full-resolution images to the photo-sharing site Flickr. You can [browser our images here](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/normanbleventhalmapcenter/). We are no longer actively adding new material to our Flickr collections.
