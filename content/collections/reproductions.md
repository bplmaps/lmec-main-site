## Purchasing a reproduction

We offer a handfull of fine art quality reproductions for purchase in our [online store](https://www.leventhalmap.org/store/). 

<!--
We offer fine art quality reproductions of all the maps in our Digital Collections which are not under copyright.

To purchase a reproduction, visit our [Digital Collections portal](https://collections.leventhalmap.org). (For more information about searching our digitized material, see [Searching the Collections](https://www.leventhalmap.org/collections/searching/)). If a map in the Digital Collections portal is available for reproduction, you will see a link with the text "Buy a Reproduction" in the "Share" panel. Clicking this button will take you to our reproduction purchase form, where you can select dimensions and paper stock.

Our reproductions are serviced by a third-party vendor. For more information, or to check on the status of an existing order, please email us at [frontdesk@leventhalmap.org](mailto:frontdesk@leventhalmap.org).

## Requesting a low or no cost reproduction

We support the work of cultural, educational, and environmental nonprofits and government agencies by offering low or no cost reproductions printed in-house. Requests for subvented reproductions should be made by nonprofit organizations who plan to display the objects in a public or classroom setting, such as a trailhead kiosk, bulletin board, classroom table, or similar display.

We generally include bibliographic information and a QR code link to the collections object in these complimentary  reproductions. You can request in-house reproductions printed on both heavy stock paper and adhesive vinyl.

Please fill out this form to submit a request for a low or now cost reproduction.
