## Purchasing a reproduction

We offer a selection of fine art quality reproductions for purchase in our [online store](https://www.leventhalmap.org/store/). Reproductions can be picked up at the Leventhal Center for free or shipped to any U.S. address.

## Requesting a low or no cost reproduction

We support the work of cultural, educational, and environmental nonprofits and government agencies by offering low or no cost reproductions printed in-house. Requests for subvented reproductions should be made by nonprofit organizations who plan to display the objects in a public or classroom setting, such as a trailhead kiosk, bulletin board, classroom table, or similar display.

We generally include bibliographic information and a QR code link to the collections object in these complimentary  reproductions. You can request in-house reproductions printed on both heavy stock paper and adhesive vinyl.

Please fill out this form to submit a request for a low or now cost reproduction.
