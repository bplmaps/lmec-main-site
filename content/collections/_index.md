## Overview of the collections

The Leventhal Map & Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. Most, though not all, of our physical objects are housed on location at our gallery and research center at the [Central Library in Copley Square](about/hours-directions). All of our collections holdings are available for access to researchers [by appointment](research/appointments), and many are available as [digital collections](collections/digital-collections).

### Collection strengths

Chronologically, the Center's collections span from the fifteenth century to the present day, and geographically cover all world regions. The strongest areas of the collections are objects whose geographic extent includes Boston, Massachusetts, and New England. Many of the Map Center's most significant collections from the early modern period were previously held in the Rare Books department, while many of our nineteenth century materials were formerly held in the Prints department. As a federal depository library, the Map Center, together with the Government Documents section of the BPL, holds many thousands of maps produced by federal, state, and local governments, as well as from agencies related to defense, environmental management, and urban and regional planning.

#### Collections of Distinction

Our collections include four named Collections of Distinction:

- American Revolutionary War Era Maps
- Boston and New England
- Urban Maps
- Maritime Charts and Atlases

#### The Mapping Boston Collection

The Mapping Boston Collection, formally owned by the nonprofit Mapping Boston Foundation, consists of the rare maps collected by Norman B. Leventhal during his lifetime. The maps in this collection range from fifteenth century world maps produced during the Age of Exploration to many of the most important maps of Boston and New England in the colonial period and early republic. In-person access to items in the Mapping Boston Collection is available only by [advance appointment](research/appointments) and [online](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/collections/commonwealth:jq086303k). Many of the Mapping Boston Collection objects are described in the 1999 book _Mapping Boston_ (MIT Press), available [in the library](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/5157593075) and [for purchase](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mapping-boston).

### Other geographic resources at the BPL

The BPL's research collections include many geographic resources not housed at the Map Center.
