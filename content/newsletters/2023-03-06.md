- content_block_header: 'Black Boston Stories: Meet Florida Ruffin Ridley'
  content_block_text: 'The maps in our featured exhibition, [_Building Blocks: Boston
    Stories from Urban Atlases_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/),
    tell stories that are ultimately about people. The stories of some people, however,
    are harder to find than others. To illuminate the lives and stories that sometimes
    run hidden through these maps, we follow the biography of an important Black Bostonian,
    **Florida Ruffin Ridley**, who worked, studied, played, and created within the
    landscapes on display.'
