      We’re so excited to share that we’ve just been awarded an [NEH Digital
      Humanities Advancement
      Grant](https://www.neh.gov/news/neh-announces-413-million-280-humanities-projects-nationwide)
      to make digital map collections more accessible! Over the next three
      years, we’ll be working with the [American Geographical Society
      Library](https://uwm.edu/libraries/agsl/), [Bert
      Spaan](https://bertspaan.nl/), and [Jules
      Schoonman](https://sammeltassen.nl/)—plus many others—to build new
      features for [Allmaps](https://allmaps.org/), a free and open-source
      platform for georeferencing digitized maps. In the coming months, we’ll
      focus on making it easier for map-holding institutions both small and
      large to incorporate Allmaps into their collections.
