    tool, which allows you to see the relative size of (large) objects in any location
    in the world, we discovered how fun it can be to clip out images from an aerial
    map and compare them next to one another. That led to our latest map visualization,

  content_block_text: Join us in-person next Wednesday at the [Roxbury Branch](https://www.bpl.org/locations/19/)
    of the Boston Public Library for a talk by LMEC 2021-22 Public Research Fellow
    [Madeline Webster](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/madeline-webster/)
    looking at adaptive reuse of buildings in the Roxbury neighborhood. Webster will
    discuss how Black Bostonians converted upper Roxbury’s Victorian-era single-family
    houses into multi-family homes in the postwar era, and how this additional income
    from rent allowed owner-occupants to build equity and maintain their houses despite
    exclusion from traditional funding sources.
