  content_block_text: |-
    Are you an educator who wants to learn more about integrating discussions of environmental justice into your teaching? Educators at LMEC and the [Tsongas Industrial History Center](https://www.uml.edu/tsongas/) in Lowell are running a three-day summer workshop for teachers exploring environmental justice in Eastern Massachusetts. Hear from activists and educators about how to support student-led civics projects, and develop your own lessons and activities.

    LMEC educators will also present three lessons created as part of the current exhibition: [A Tale of Two Bays](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/lessons/two-bays/), [Near and Far: Oil](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/lessons/near-far/), and [Visualizing Environmental Justice Activism](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/lessons/activism/).

  content_block_header: 'In-Person: Preserving Roxbury’s Housing Through Adaptive
    Reuse · June 15, 4pm ET'
  content_block_text: Join us at the [Roxbury Branch](https://www.bpl.org/locations/19/)
    of the Boston Public Library for a talk by LMEC 2021-22 Public Research Fellow
    [Madeline Webster](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/madeline-webster/)
    looking at adaptive reuse of buildings in the neighborhood of Roxbury. Maddie
    will discuss how Black Bostonians converted upper Roxbury’s Victorian-era single-family
    houses into multi-family homes in the postwar era, and how this additional income
    from rent allowed owner-occupants to build equity and maintain their houses despite
    exclusion from traditional funding sources.

- content_block_header: 'Building Futures in Boston for Community Land Trusts '
  content_block_text: What can community control of development and housing look like
    and how can it change a neighborhood over time? Our conversation with René Mardones
    and Minnie McMahon of [Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative (DSNI)](https://www.dsni.org/)
    focused on the challenges in preserving and creating affordable housing in the
    Roxbury neighborhood of Boston and provided history and background to the community
    land trust movement within the city. We also showed historic maps of the urban
    infrastructure of Roxbury from the 19th century to the present, underscoring the
    environmental and policy changes in this neighborhood over time.
