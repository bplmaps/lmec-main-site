introductory_text: >
  Like so many people who grew up in the Boston region, my first mental map of
  the shape of the city was the red, green, orange, and blue diagram that
  depicts the MBTA subway lines. Boston has one of the oldest and most extensive
  public transit systems in the United States, and choices made long ago about
  where to lay down transit infrastructure still have profound consequences on
  millions of people’s daily lives. With the opening of our new exhibition
  Getting Around Town on September 9, we’ll be surrounded by transit maps: not
  only the familiar pattern of our modern MBTA, but also its predecessors
  stretching all the way back to the seventeenth century. It’s an opportunity
  not only to think about the past, but the future as well, and to dream about
  what a more inclusive and extensive geography of getting around town might
  look like. We can’t wait to see you in the gallery soon.

      Opening This Week: Getting Around Town: Four Centuries of Mapping Boston
      in Transit 
    content_block_text: >
      Our new exhibition, Getting Around Town: Four Centuries of Mapping Boston
      in Transit, opens this Saturday, September 9! In Getting Around Town, we
      follow the evolution of the public transit systems that have shuttled
      people around Boston, connected neighborhoods, and shaped the experience
      of the city for generations of Bostonians. From the early days of
      horse-drawn carriages and streetcars to the modern-day subway system, the
      exhibition showcases the innovative ideas and technological advances that
      have transformed Boston’s transportation landscape over the past four
      centuries. Maps document the changing form of these transit networks, and
      also show how the systems influenced the growth of the city around them.

    content_block_text: "“Since landing in North America, the Puritan colonists had relied on the expertise of Indigenous peoples as they walked forests, farms, and pathways that Algonquian-speaking peoples had created. When the English got lost, Algonquians rescued them. When the English traveled, Algonquians guided them,” writes\_[Nathan Braccio](https://nathanbraccio.com/), Assistant Professor of History at [Lesley University](https://lesley.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/nathan-braccio), in this new digital publication looking at Indigenous presence in one of the earliest maps of the Massachusetts Bay colony.

      “Boston’s circulatory system isn’t just red. It’s multi-colored: Red,
