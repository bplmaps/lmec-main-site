      In the cold November rain, over 3000 social studies teachers from around
      the country gathered in Boston for the annual National Council for the
      Social Studies conference. The LMEC Education team welcomed educators to
      the Leventhal Center for three days of workshops and open houses. We
      appreciated teachersâ€™ excitement about the collection and our work
      creating teaching material on social studies themes. It was equally
      important for our team to get feedback from teachers directly, echoing
      what colleagues in Greater Boston have emphasized: teachers need resources
      and programs that they can readily adapt to their classrooms.


      In this article, Director of Education **Nicole Claris** reflects on the
      experience of NCSS Boston and looks ahead to new educational offerings
      from the Leventhal Center.
