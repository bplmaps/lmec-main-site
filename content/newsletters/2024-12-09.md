      In the cold November rain, over 3000 social studies teachers from around
      the country gathered in Boston for the annual National Council for the
      Social Studies conference. The LMEC Education team welcomed educators to
      the Leventhal Center for three days of workshops and open houses. We
      appreciated teachers’ excitement about the collection and our work
      creating teaching material on social studies themes. It was equally
      important for our team to get feedback from teachers directly, echoing
      what colleagues in Greater Boston have emphasized: teachers need resources
      and programs that they can readily adapt to their classrooms.


      In this article, Director of Education **Nicole Claris** reflects on the
      experience of NCSS Boston and looks ahead to new educational offerings
      from the Leventhal Center.

      Join **Julia Williams**, Gallery & Communications Coordinator at the
      Leventhal Map & Education Center, to discuss the use of historic maps for
      genealogical research together with BPL Research Services. Julia has
      experience working with New England Historical Genealogical Society as a
      genealogist on [10 Million Names](https://10millionnames.org/), a project
      aimed at recovering the names of the estimated ten million men, women, and
      children of African descent who were enslaved in pre- and post-colonial
      America. She will also provide a demo of
      [Atlascope](https://www.atlascope.org/), which overlays historic property
      maps on top of modern-day ones so you can easily compare past and present.

    content_block_text: >
      During the early years of Back Bay’s development, Copley Square was
      established as a museum hub, before several institutions left the area for
      larger buildings. Along with the BPL and the Boston Society of Natural
      History (the predecessor of the Museum of Science), what other major
      museum was in Copley Square between 1876 and 1909?


      1. Boston Athenaeum

      2. Boston Children’s Museum

      3. Museum of Fine Arts

      4. The Institute of Contemporary Art


      The answer to the question of what park feature was circled in the 1917
      Atlas of the Charles River Esplanade was **Gymnastics grounds**. 


      Correct answers will be included in a random draw—the winner will receive
      the next three [Map of the Month
      club](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/map-of-the-month/) postcards for
