    content_block_text: >
      Maybe you knew that the Museum of Fine Arts once sat on Copley Square next
      to the BPL—but did you know there were once two art schools in the area as
      well? In this chronological journey through the neighborhoods that shaped
      Boston’s fine arts culture, the Leventhal Center’s Fall 2024 Co-op student
      **Sam Walker** details the founding and initial steps of nineteenth
      century Boston’s burgeoning fine arts community.

  - content_block_header: Your Support Makes Our World Go Around!
    content_block_text: "2024 was a year for the books! This past year, our gallery saw three different exhibits (*[Getting Around Town](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/)*, *[Heaven & Earth](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/)*, and *[Processing Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/)*), we hosted 38 public events, and welcomed over 57,000 visitors. Our digital collection remained an incredible tool for research, with over 246,000 visitors searching for maps. Additionally, we added 21 new atlas layers to [Atlascope](http://atlascope.org/) as part of our project to expand our coverage of Massachusetts towns in the tool. This past year was one of growth for our Education team, as we welcomed three new staff members and hosted 31 visits from local schools.\n\nWe’re grateful for our community of friends and map lovers—we look forward to spending 2025 continuing to strengthen and expand our commitment to free and accessible collections and resources, public interpretation and research, and work with educators and students. If you’d like to help support new and innovative projects in 2025, please consider\_[supporting us with a gift of any size](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/).\n"

  - content_block_header: From The Vault December Roundup
    content_block_text: >
      In December, we hosted two From The Vault events: **[Unconventional
      Maps](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-unconventional-maps/)**,
      which highlighted a variety of unconventional cartographic styles, and
      **[LMEC Community: Best Maps of
      2024](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-lmec-community-best-maps-of-2024/)**,
      which featured the most popular maps accessed in our digital collections
      in 2024. These events asked our visitors to think deeper about each map’s
      creation and purpose, and we invite you explore these same questions in
      these roundup articles.

      The Greater Boston Digital Research and Pedagogy Symposium is a regional,
