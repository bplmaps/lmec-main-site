      Maybe you knew that the Museum of Fine Arts once sat on Copley Square next
      to the BPL—but did you know there were once two art schools in the area as
      well? In this chronological journey through the neighborhoods that shaped
      Boston’s fine arts culture, the Leventhal Center’s Fall 2024 Co-op student
      **Sam Walker** details the founding and initial steps of nineteenth
      century Boston’s burgeoning fine arts community.
