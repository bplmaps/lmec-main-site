  Dear Friend,


  There’s just one week remaining in our [June matching
  fundraiser](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/), and we’re a little behind
  our goal of raising $10,000 before the end of our fiscal year. All of the
  things you read about in this newsletter and in all of our updates are only
  possible because people like you are willing to support them. [Can you chip in
  at this key moment and help us reach our $10,000 match before this opportunity
  vanishes on Friday](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/?form=GENCAMPAIGN)? If
  you can take less than a minute to [contribute $25, $10, or even just $3
  towards our goal](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/?form=GENCAMPAIGN)
  before reading on, your support will go a long ways towards making a real
  impact on the year ahead.


  With our ongoing appreciation for you choosing to be a part of our community,


  The LMEC Team

    content_block_text: >
      For the 2023 Designer-in-Residence fellowship, we asked [Andy
      Woodruff](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/interview-with-andy-woodruff/)
      to respond creatively to the visual prompt of the fire insurance atlases
      shown in our ongoing [Building
      Blocks](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/)
      exhibition. Over the course of his four-week residency at the Leventhal
      Center, Andy produced two new twists on the historic urban atlases. One
      depicts modern-day [flood
      risk](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1z40px27t)
      in East Boston, and the other documents [neighborhood
      change](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?f%5Bsubject_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Professions--Massachusetts--Boston--Maps)
      at the street level in three snapshots of the early twentieth century.

    content_block_text: "Look familiar? This [map](https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn92531_001/) “depicts in meticulous detail the sugar warehouses and associated railway depots and shipping docks of twenty-one Cuban towns, with an eye towards technical details like loading capacity and building material. This is the same visual language almost exclusively used by map-making companies to depict urban cities like Boston,” writes Northeastern University co-op student\_[Patricio Pino](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/patricio-pino/) in his latest article tracing webs of influence and power across the global landscape. \n"
