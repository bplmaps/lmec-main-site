  Dear Friend,


  There’s just one week remaining in our [June matching
  fundraiser](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/), and we’re a little behind
  our goal of raising $10,000 before the end of our fiscal year. All of the
  things you read about in this newsletter, on our
  [website](https://www.leventhalmap.org/) and [social media
  pages](https://www.instagram.com/bplmaps/) are only possible because people
  like you are willing to support them. [Can you chip in at this key moment and
  help us reach our $10,000 match before this opportunity vanishes on
  Friday](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/?form=GENCAMPAIGN)? If you can
  take less than a minute to [contribute $25, $10, or even just $3 towards our
  goal](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/?form=GENCAMPAIGN) before reading
  on, your support will go a long ways towards making a real impact on the year
  ahead.


  With our ongoing appreciation for you choosing to be a part of our community,


  The LMEC Team

  - content_block_header: Design Experiments with Urban Atlases
    content_block_text: >
      For the 2023 Designer-in-Residence fellowship, we asked [Andy
      Woodruff](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/interview-with-andy-woodruff/)
      to respond creatively to the visual prompt of the fire insurance atlases
      shown in our ongoing [Building
      Blocks](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/)
      exhibition. Over the course of his four-week residency at the Leventhal
      Center, Andy produced two new twists on the historic urban atlases. One
      depicts modern-day [flood
      risk](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1z40px27t)
      in East Boston, and the other documents [neighborhood
      change](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?f%5Bsubject_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Professions--Massachusetts--Boston--Maps)
      at the street level in three snapshots of the early twentieth century.

    content_block_text: "Look familiar? This [map](https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn92531_001/) “depicts in meticulous detail the sugar warehouses and associated railway depots and shipping docks of twenty-one Cuban towns, with an eye towards technical details like loading capacity and building material. This is the same visual language almost exclusively used by map-making companies to depict urban cities like Boston,” writes Northeastern University co-op student\_[Patricio Pino](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/patricio-pino/) in his latest article tracing webs of influence across the globe.\n"
