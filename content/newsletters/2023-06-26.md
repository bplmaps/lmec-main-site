  Dear Friend,


  There’s just one week remaining in our [June matching
  fundraiser](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/), and we’re a little behind
  our goal of raising $10,000 before the end of our fiscal year. All of the
  things you read about in this newsletter and in all of our updates are only
  possible because people like you are willing to support them. [Can you chip in
  at this key moment and help us reach our $10,000 match before this opportunity
  vanishes on Friday](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/?form=GENCAMPAIGN)? If
  you can take less than a minute to [contribute $25, $10, or even just $3
  towards our goal](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/?form=GENCAMPAIGN)
  before reading on, your support will go a long ways towards making a real
  impact on the year ahead.


  With our ongoing appreciation for you choosing to be a part of our community,


  The LMEC team
