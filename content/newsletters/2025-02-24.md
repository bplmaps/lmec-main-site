These tours show how our modern city has grown in tandem with Boston’s one-of-a-kind park system.\n"

      Support the David J. Weaver GIS Research Fund through March 31 and double
      your impact!


      The collections of David J. Weaver, a Massachusetts cartographer and GIS
      practitioner, have made the Leventhal Center a leading site for studying
      the history of computer cartography and geographic information systems.
      The David J. Weaver GIS Research Fund builds upon Weaver’s work and
      passion, and through the end of our current exhibition *[Processing
      Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/)*
      you can have the opportunity to support future discovery in the history of
      computer cartography. Donations to the Weaver Fund through March 31 will
      be doubled by an anonymous match!

      Spotlight: Brown Seminar on the Historical Geography of the American
      Revolutionary War Era 
    content_block_text: >
      Our upcoming exhibition, *[Terrains of
      Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/terrains-of-independence-preview/)*,
      focuses on the ways in which Boston’s geography informed and influenced
      the city’s role in the American Revolution. This local geography is part
      of a larger geographic story in which American Indians, Europeans, and
      Africans came into contact and conflict on the borderlands of North
      America.


      In this 2021 lecture, scholar **Kathleen DuVal** takes us on a journey
      through geographies of the American Revolution that are often omitted from
      the popular imagination of this time period. DuVal’s presentation is part
      of the Richard H. Brown Seminar on the Historical Geography of the
      American Revolutionary Era and features maps that can be found in the
      [ARGO (American Revolutionary Geographies
      Online)](https://www.argomaps.org/) portal.
