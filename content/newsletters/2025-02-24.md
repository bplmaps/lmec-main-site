    content_block_text: "This fall, the Leventhal Center’s Geohumanities & GIS interns helped expand [Atlascope](https://www.atlascope.org/) by georeferencing new urban atlas layers using [Allmaps](https://allmaps.org/), researching geospatial datasets, and writing original Atlascope tours.\_Thanks to the work of **Idana Wilson**\_and\_**Ava Wilcox**, we two new Atlascope tours are now available. These tours show how our modern city has grown in tandem with Boston’s one-of-a-kind park system.\n"
