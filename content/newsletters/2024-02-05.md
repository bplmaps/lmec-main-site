      LivableStreets](https://www.livablestreets.info/), and Reggie Ramos,

      TransitMatters Virtual Webinar: Transportation Advocacy and the Data
      Dashboard
    content_block_text: >
      Join us for a virtual event with TransitMatters on February 21 7-8 pm ET,
      as they discuss their award-winning Data Dashboard tool, and the impact
      that open data has had on transportation advocacy nationwide. Since its
      founding, TransitMatters has focused on helping Greater Boston advocate
      for the safe, frequent, and reliable transit. The TransitMatters Labs Team
      drives transportation advocacy by building tools with MBTA data to engage
      the public and increase transparency.


      The Data Dashboard has played a prominent role in increasing awareness
      about slow zones throughout the MBTA network. Join the webinar to learn
      more about how this tool was built and discuss future possibilities for
      civic data design.

    content_block_text: "Supported by the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/), Joan Brunetta and Eve Loftus made use of early Census data to document and located Black Cantabrigians in the years 1790–1820. At this time, census takers recorded only scant information, and the majority of people of color were known only as tally marks in the “all other free persons” data column. \n\nBy conducting careful research, Brunetta and Loftus were able to find 66 unique Cambridge households with at least one Black resident and created an interactive map showing 35 locations where they could identify residents’ locations in the city. \n"
