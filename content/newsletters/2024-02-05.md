      TransitMatters Virtual Webinar: Transportation Advocacy and the Data
      Dashboard
    content_block_text: >
      Join us for a virtual event with TransitMatters on February 21 7-8 pm ET,
      as they discuss their award-winning Data Dashboard tool, and the impact
      that open data has had on transportation advocacy nationwide. Since its
      founding, TransitMatters has focused on helping Greater Boston advocate
      for the safe, frequent, and reliable transit. The TransitMatters Labs Team
      drives transportation advocacy by building tools with MBTA data to engage
      the public and increase transparency. 


      The Data Dashboard has played a prominent role in increasing awareness
      about slow zones throughout the MBTA network. Join the webinar to learn
      more about how this tool was built and discuss future possibilities for
      civic data design.
