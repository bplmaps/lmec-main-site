      Our Spring 2024 conversation series Routes Ahead of Us kicks off this
      month! In this first program, Stacy Thompson, Executive Director of[
      LivableStreets](https://www.livablestreets.info/), and Reggie Ramos,
      Executive Director of[ Transportation for
      Massachusetts](https://www.t4ma.org/), will discuss contemporary social
      and political forces shaping transportation policy in Greater Boston.


      Throughout the remainder of the series, we'll take the themes of our
      current exhibition [Getting Around
      Town](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/)
      and consider the history of Boston’s transit system with questions about
      how to build a better, more equitable urban mobility system in the future.

      TransitMatters Virtual Webinar: Transportation Advocacy and the Data
      Dashboard
    content_block_text: >
      Join us for a virtual event with TransitMatters on February 21 7-8 pm ET,
      as they discuss their award-winning Data Dashboard tool, and the impact
      that open data has had on transportation advocacy nationwide. Since its
      founding, TransitMatters has focused on helping Greater Boston advocate
      for the safe, frequent, and reliable transit. The TransitMatters Labs Team
      drives transportation advocacy by building tools with MBTA data to engage
      the public and increase transparency.


      The Data Dashboard has played a prominent role in increasing awareness
      about slow zones throughout the MBTA network. Join the webinar to learn
      more about how this tool was built and discuss future possibilities for
      civic data design.

    content_block_text: "Supported by the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/), Joan Brunetta and Eve Loftus made use of early Census data to document and located Black Cantabrigians in the years 1790–1820. At this time, census takers recorded only scant information, and the majority of people of color were known only as tally marks in the “all other free persons” data column. \n\nBy conducting careful research, Brunetta and Loftus were able to find 66 unique Cambridge households with at least one Black resident and created an interactive map showing 35 locations where they could identify residents’ locations in the city. \n"

  - content_block_header: 'Teachers: Join us for a 2024 Summer Institute!'
    content_block_text: >
      This summer we will welcome 25 educators in grades 3-12 to Portland,
      Maine, and Boston, Massachusetts, from July 14 to July 26, 2024 for the
      NEH Summer Institute “Teaching With Maps: Community and Resilience in
      Maritime New England,” in partnership with the Osher Map Library and Smith
      Center for Cartographic Education.


      During the two-week program, teachers will explore how maps and landscapes
      reflect, erase, obscure, and celebrate Black and Indigenous geographies
      and histories along New England’s maritime coast. All participants will
      receive a $2,200 stipend for completing the NEH Summer Institute.
      Applications close on March 5.

  - content_block_header: Featured Visitor Maps from Getting Around Town
    content_block_text: >
      If you’ve made an in-person visit to Getting Around Town, you may have
      seen our invitation to make your own maps of Boston or other parts of the
      world. We’ve gotten to see how creative and detailed our patrons have been
      and we’d like to show off some of our staff favorite maps from the
      exhibition!


      A staff member will feature their favorite maps in every newsletter going
      forward through to the end of the exhibition. Check back on social media
      or in future newsletters to see if your map made it to our feature!


      These featured maps were chosen by Lauren Chen, our Reference and
      Cataloging Librarian:
