    set up in our gallery space: two exhibitions instead of one! In addition to rotating
    exhibitions, we are thrilled to announce the addition of a permanent exhibition,
    _Becoming Boston: Eight Moments in the Geography of a Changing City,_ to remain
    on display indefinitely. _Becoming Boston_ is scheduled to open on January 13
    alongside our new rotating exhibition, _Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban
    Atlases._ '
