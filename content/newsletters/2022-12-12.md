- content_block_header: Making Sense of Noisy Data and Noise Pollution
  content_block_text: 'Boston is a particularly noisy place, as [WGBH reported in
    2019](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2019/09/17/boston-is-noisy-how-is-that-affecting-our-health),
    and sometimes the "symphony of the city" can become unbearable. In his latest
    article, [Ian Spangler](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/ian-spangler/)
    unpacks this bivariate map, which overlays noise data with population data, to
    determine where the noisiest noise intersects with the most people (and vice versa). '
