      What was it about Boston and Massachusetts in the late 1700s that made the
      region such a tinderbox for Revolutionary activity?


      In the Leventhal Map & Education Centerâ€™s upcoming exhibition Terrains of
      Independence, maps will offer a reconsideration of the Revolutionary War
      through the lens of locality and place. By emphasizing how the spaces of
      Boston and Massachusetts shaped the trajectory of a global revolutionary
      moment, the exhibit calls us to rethink familiar stories of heroic deeds
      and political passions. From zones of conflict and struggle between
      communities to the vast networks which connected Boston to a
      hemisphere-spanning empire, Terrains of Independence draws us into the
      geographic history of a foundational era.


      This forthcoming exhibition is curated by Katy Lasdow and Garrett Dash
      Nelson.
