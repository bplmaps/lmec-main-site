  content_block_text: 'For our new rotating exhibition, [_Building Blocks: Boston
    Stories from Urban Atlases_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/),
    the Map Center hired and worked with three high school students from Boston Public
    Schools as teen curators. We asked them to choose a place in the city and explore
    that site’s history going back to the nineteenth century, using our [urban atlas
    collection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=urban+atlas&search_field=all_fields)
    to kick off their research.'
