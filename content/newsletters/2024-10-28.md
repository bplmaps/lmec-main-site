    content_block_text: >
      We’re thrilled to announce that the Leventhal Center has been awarded a
      grant from Mass Humanities as part of their [Expanding Massachusetts
      Stories](https://masshumanities.org/2024-ems-grants/) (EMS) Initiative.
      This grant will support a new collaborative educational partnership with
      the Boston Area Technical Academy (BATA) called “Getting To Here: How
      Immigration Shapes an American City.” In this partnership, LMEC educators
      will work with BATA teachers and students to create and exhibit maps that
      demonstrate how immigrants have and continue to shape Boston. In total,
      the Center was part of a cohort of 64 organizations across Massachusetts
      that received $1.2 million in grant funding—congratulations to all our
      fellow grantees!

    content_block_text: >
      The most recent program in the Richard H. Brown Seminar Series on the
      Historical Geography of the American Revolutionary Era featured a
      discussion with **Martin Brückner** of the University of Delaware. In this
      program, Brückner spoke about how the consumer revolution of the
      eighteenth century profoundly affected people’s material lives and paved
      the way for other more momentous political revolutions. The recorded
      seminar is now available to watch on our website.

  - content_block_header: Riding Around Boston
    content_block_text: >
      In the second half of his *Seeing Boston* series, friend of the Center
      **Gerald A. Rosenthal** invites us onto the trolley to view daily life in
      1906 Boston. After taking us through the history and infrastructure of
      Boston in 1906, Rosenthal expands on what daily life as an early
      twentieth-century Bostonian may have looked like and how we can see
      ripples of this history in our current city.

  - content_block_header: October "From the Vault" Highlights
    content_block_text: >
      In late September and October, we hosted three *From The Vault* events,
      [Behind the Scenes of Processing
      Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-behind-the-scenes-of-processing-place/),
      [Time Travel Back to 1906
      Boston](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-time-travel-back-to-1906-boston/),
      and [Out With the Old, In With the
      New](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new/).
      *From The Vault* is a biweekly event series featuring collections objects.
      Each program revolves around a theme to explore and objects are on display
      in our Learning Center for the afternoon to come in and view these amazing
      artifacts. This month’s showings were curated and captioned by our
      Assistant Director, a longtime friend of the Center, and our Northeastern
      co-op student. We invite you to take a look at what they pulled from the
      collections in these roundup articles!

      For nearly a century and well into the mid-1900s, Cambridge, Massachusetts
      was a major candy making center and was responsible for many of the
      classic candies people still know and love. Though most of the factories
      have closed, which of the following candies is still being manufactured in
      Cambridge today?


      * Squirrel Nut Zippers

      * Charleston Chews

      * Sugar Daddies

      * Junior Mints


      The answer to the last Newsletter Trivia question about the 1875 tunnel
      still in use today is the **[Hoosac
      Tunnel](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wd376624v)**.
