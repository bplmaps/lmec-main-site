      In the second half of his Seeing Boston series, friend of the Center
      **Gerald A. Rosenthal** invites us onto the trolly to view daily life in
      1906 Boston. After taking us through the history and infrastructure of
      Boston in 1906, Rosenthal expands on what daily life as an early
      twentieth-century Bostonian may have looked like and how we can see
      ripples of this history in our current city.
