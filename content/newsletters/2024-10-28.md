  - content_block_header: Riding Around Boston
    content_block_text: >
      In the second half of his Seeing Boston series, friend of the Center
      **Gerald A. Rosenthal** invites us onto the trolly to view daily life in
      1906 Boston. After taking us through the history and infrastructure of
      Boston in 1906, Rosenthal expands on what daily life as an early
      twentieth-century Bostonian may have looked like and how we can see
      ripples of this history in our current city.

  - content_block_header: October "From the Vault" Highlights
    content_block_text: >
      In late September and October, we hosted three *From The Vault* events-[
      Behind the Scenes of Processing
      Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-behind-the-scenes-of-processing-place/),
      [Time Travel Back to 1906
      Boston](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-time-travel-back-to-1906-boston/),
      and Out With the Old, In With the New. *From The Vault* is a biweekly
      event series featuring collections objects. Each program revolves around a
      theme to explore and objects are on display in our Learning Center for the
      afternoon to come in and view these amazing artifacts. This month’s
      showings were curated and captioned by our Assistant Director, a longtime
      friend of the Center, and our Northeastern co-op student. We invite you to
      take a look at what they pulled from the collections in these roundup
      articles!

      For nearly a century and well into the mid-1900s, Cambridge, Massachusetts
      was a major candy making town and is responsible for many of the classic
      candies people still know and love. Though most of the factories have
      closed, which of the following candies is still being manufactured in
      Cambridge today?


      * Squirrel Nut Zippers

      * Charleston Chews

      * Sugar Daddies

      * Junior Mints


      The answer to the last Newsletter Trivia question about the 1875 tunnel
      still in use today is the **Hoosac Tunnel**.
