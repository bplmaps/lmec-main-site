      In the newest publication from the MacLean Collectionâ€™s Map Chat series,
      **Dr. Mimi Cheng** explores a curious pair of nineteenth-century maps of
      Beijing. Despite differences in production, language, and time period, the
      two maps are remarkably similar, prompting questions about the long
      lifespans of maps and cartography.
