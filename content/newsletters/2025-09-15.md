    content_block_text: >
      In the newest publication from the MacLean Collection’s Map Chat series,
      **Dr. Mimi Cheng** explores a curious pair of nineteenth-century maps of
      Beijing. Despite differences in production, language, and time period, the
      two maps are remarkably similar, prompting questions about the long
      lifespans of maps and cartography.

      Last Chance: Urban Space, Water, and Health in Colonial Charleston
      (Virtual) · Sep 16, 6 pm ET 
    content_block_text: "Join us **tomorrow**, September 16, for a conversation in the [Brown Seminar on the Historical Geography of the American Revolutionary Era](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/richard-h.-brown-seminar/) with historian **Molly Nebiolo**. Professor Nebiolo\_will explore the colonial geography of Charleston with a focus on tidal creeks and other waterbodies—both those marked on maps of this period as well as those hidden in the cartographic record. These maps open up a new perspective on the history of health and environment in the eighteenth century colonial American city. *This program is part of the [American Revolutionary Geographies Online (ARGO)](https://www.argomaps.org/) project.*\n"

  - content_block_header: 'In-Person: Unconventional Views of the World · September 19, 2 pm ET'
    content_block_text: "So… what if we told you the world map you’re used to seeing isn’t actually “the most accurate” depiction of the world we inhabit?\n\nThe Mercator projection, introduced in 1569 by Gerardus Mercator, has long been considered a “default” world map, especially amongst audiences in the Western Hemisphere. Every type of projection distorts the original geometry of the curved, three-dimensional earth in some way, but because we're so used to seeing projected maps of the globe, those distortions no longer look strange to us. But can older maps help us refresh our view to see things a little differently?\n\nWe’ll take a closer look at maps from the Leventhal Center’s collection as we answer these questions during this *From the Vault*\_map collection showing!\n"

      Virtual Teacher Workshop: What Can a Map Do? Teaching Maps for Elementary
      School Students · October 8, 6:30 pm ET 
    content_block_text: >
      Maps can foster curiosity and help young learners make sense of the world
      around them. In this workshop, we’ll explore how to use both historic maps
      and hands-on mapping activities to build spatial thinking and support
      cross-curricular learning in elementary classrooms.
