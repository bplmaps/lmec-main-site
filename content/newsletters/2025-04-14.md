      Article · Planting the Seeds of Rebellion: The Battle of Lake George,
      September 8, 1755
    content_block_text: >
      On April 19, 2025, our nation will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the
      1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord. In the earlier war, Britain and its
      colonists were faithfully aligned against territorial claims by France.
      So, what motivated a loosely organized rural populace to challenge the
      British empire—with one of the most highly trained armies in the world—in
      a series of brisk skirmishes that would lead to the Revolutionary war?


      In searching for answers, most historians focus on the aftermath of that
      earlier conflict.  Often overlooked is another military engagement that
      occurred during the chaotic beginnings of The Seven Years’ War. On
      September 8, 1755, a remarkable sequence of battles at Lake George, New
      York planted seeds of rebellion and independence in the burgeoning
      American psyche that subsequently blossomed at Lexington and Concord.
