      In honor of the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord,

      Department are collaborating on an open house highlighting items from our
      collections relating to the opening salvo of the war, as well as other
      major events of the American Revolution in Boston.


      Stop by the Center’s gallery to see our new exhibition and then head into
      our classroom to see related items from Special Collections across a
      variety of formats. This open house will take place on both Saturday,
      April 19 and Tuesday, April 22 from 11 am–4 pm with staff members
      available to answer questions. The same items will be on display at both
      open houses.
