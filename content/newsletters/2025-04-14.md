      is here! In the past two weeks, we’ve begun to welcome visitors to our
      newest exhibition, which uses maps and geography to explore Boston’s role
      in the American Revolution. Designed to prompt the question “Why here?,”
      *Terrains of Independence* offers all visitors—from American Revolution
      buffs to elementary school students—a new perspective the importance of
      place and locality in understanding how the United States became and
      independent nation.
