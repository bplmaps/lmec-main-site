  content_block_header: 'In-Person: Preserving Roxbury’s Housing Through Adaptive
    Reuse · June 15, 4pm ET'
  content_block_text: Join us at the [Roxbury Branch](https://www.bpl.org/locations/19/)
    of the Boston Public Library for a talk by LMEC 2021-22 Public Research Fellow
    [Madeline Webster](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/madeline-webster/)
    looking at adaptive reuse of buildings in the neighborhood of Roxbury. Maddie
    will discuss how Black Bostonians converted upper Roxbury’s Victorian-era single-family
    houses into multi-family homes in the postwar era, and how this additional income
    from rent allowed owner-occupants to build equity and maintain their houses despite
    exclusion from traditional funding sources.
