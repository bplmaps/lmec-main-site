  content_block_text: Have you paid a visit to our ongoing _Building Blocks_ exhibition?
    (We're about to reach 12,000 visitors!) The text here was written by Exhibition
    Curatorial Fellow Laura Lee Schmidt for the [January 2023 opening event](https://www.leventhalmap.org/event/curatorial-introduction-to-building-blocks/)
    for _Building Blocks_. With the popularity of the exhibition to date, we have
    reprinted the text of the talk, along with accompanying visuals.
