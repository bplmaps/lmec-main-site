  - content_block_header: Last Chance to Re-Name Your Subway Station
    content_block_text: >
      Tomorrow is Giving Tuesday, and your last chance to support our work by
      re-naming your favorite (or most-hated!) T station! Our current
      fundraising auction encourages YOU to re-imagine what Boston’s subway map
      might look like. Claim your station today by placing a $5 or $10 bid.
      Winners not only get to name their station, but receive a copy of the
      final map—which will also hang in our gallery and live in our digital
      collections.
