introductory_text: "Now that the marathon runners have made their annual pilgrimage
  down Boylston Street past the Central Library, we're celebrating the start of spring
  in Boston. With that comes (hopefully) warmer temperatures and excuses to move our
  meetings outside to the Library's courtyard. We've been focused on early events
  as part of [_More or Less in Common_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/)
  and that has given us a number of opportunities to think about intersections of
  environmental justice, climate justice, and social movements. Our exhibitions give
  us a chance to continue learning as a staff about the subjects discussed in the
  show and we've found that visits from community members, patrons, students, and
  researchers are one important way we do that. So if you're local, [swing by](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/hours-directions/)
  as your schedule allows! \n\nAnd if you're looking for a book to continue in the
  Earth Day spirit, some members of staff are reading [_Waste: One Woman's Fight Against
  America's Dirty Secret_](https://thenewpress.com/books/waste) by Catherine Coleman
  Flowers, a 2020 MacArthur Fellow and environmental health researcher. It's an important
  and compelling read and [we'd love to hear from you](mailto:info@leventhalmap.org)
  if you have thoughts on the book!"

  content_block_text: 'We were thrilled to welcome _Boston Globe_ journalist [Renée
    Loth](https://twitter.com/reneeloth) to our exhibition _More or Less in Common_.
    Her [thoughtful review](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/04/22/opinion/mapping-environmental-justice/)
    highlighted some of the most important ideas we wanted to talk about in this show,
    but her [tweet](https://twitter.com/reneeloth/status/1517496183186505732) might
    have summed it up best: "Far from dusty relics of a pre-digital age, maps like
    the ones at the Boston Public Library can help us visualize environmental justice
    & be tools for civic activism."'

- content_block_header: 'Power, Paper, and PCBs: An Environmental History of the Lower
    Neponset River'
  content_block_text: If you lived in Boston in the 1960s, you might remember the
    Baker Chocolate Works factory and smells of chocolate wafting up from the banks
    of the Lower Neponset River. But today, the water and soil of the Neponset are
    dangerously contaminated with chemical waste and and hazardous materials. [Megan
    Nally](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/megan-nally/) wrote about the
    environmental history of the Lower Neponset River, just as the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA) announced the addition of the River to the Superfund National
    Priorities List, which will open up federal funds for the cleanup and remediation
    of the Neponset.

  content_block_text: What impact did the Revolution era military’s presence in American
    cities have on citizens and civilians? Tune in to hear Professor [John McCurdy](https://www.emich.edu/history-philosophy/history/faculty/j-mccurdy.php)
    unpack the geographies of contact between soldiers and civilians—from urban squares
    to barracks and lodging houses—during the Revolutionary War. McCurdy’s work examines
    the small-scale spaces where the everyday realities of life during an imperial
    conflict became personalized.
