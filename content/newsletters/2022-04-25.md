introductory_text: Now that the marathon runners have made their annual pilgrimage
  down Boylston Street past the Central Library, we're celebrating the start of spring
  in Copley Square. With that comes (hopefully) warmer temperatures and excuses to
  move our meetings outside to the Library's courtyard. With the first events of our
  new exhibition [_More or Less in Common_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/),
  we've had a number of opportunities to think about how the weather outside isn't
  just a question of fair or foul—but of community resilience and social justice.
  If you're local, [swing by](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/hours-directions/)—or,
  if you're not, check out the [virtual reality tour we've just added to the digital
  exhibition](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/).

    Loth](https://twitter.com/reneeloth) to our exhibition _More or Less in Common_.
    Her [thoughtful review](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/04/22/opinion/mapping-environmental-justice/)
    highlighted some of the most themes in our show, and her [summary on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reneeloth/status/1517496183186505732)
    may have captured the essential message of our work: "Far from dusty relics of
    a pre-digital age, maps like the ones at the Boston Public Library can help us
    visualize environmental justice & be tools for civic activism."'

  content_block_text: If you lived in Boston in the 1960s, you might remember the
    Baker Chocolate Works factory and smells of chocolate wafting up from the banks
    of the Lower Neponset River. But today, the water and soil of the Neponset are
    dangerously contaminated with chemical waste and and hazardous materials. [Megan
    Nally](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/megan-nally/) wrote about the
    environmental history of the Lower Neponset River, just as the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency (EPA) announced the addition of the river to the Superfund National
    Priorities List, which will open up federal funds for cleanup and remediation.

    unpack the geographies of contact between soldiers and civilians—from urban squares
    to barracks and lodging houses—during the Revolutionary War. McCurdy’s work examines
    the small-scale spaces where the everyday realities of life during an imperial

- content_block_header: Public Interests
  content_block_text: Ambitious urban planners, like Boston’s Edward J. Logue, once
    dreamed up massive interventions into American cities. But those plans quickly
    garnered pushback across the political spectrum. How and why did activists turn
    against government power and urban planning in the last third of the twentieth
    century? Garrett Dash Nelson looks at three new books that explore the contentious
    relationship between activism and the state, and asks what lessons we might draw
    from this era’s unintended consequence, in this [essay for _Places Journal_](https://placesjournal.org/article/the-past-and-future-of-urban-planning/).
