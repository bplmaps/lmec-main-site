introductory_text: "Now that the marathon runners have made their annual pilgrimage
  down Boylston Street past the Central Library, we're celebrating the start of spring
  in Boston. With that comes (hopefully) warmer temperatures and excuses to move our
  meetings outside to the Library's courtyard. We've been focused on early events
  as part of [_More or Less in Common_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/)
  and that has given us a number of opportunities to think about intersections of
  environmental justice, climate justice, and social movements. Our exhibitions give
  us a chance to continue learning as a staff about the subjects discussed in the
  show and we've found that visits from community members, patrons, students, and
  researchers are one important way we do that. So, [swing by](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/hours-directions/)
  as your schedule allows—we'd love to see you. \n\nAnd if you're looking for a book
  to continue in the Earth Day spirit, some members of staff are reading [_Waste:
  One Woman's Fight Against America's Dirty Secret_](https://thenewpress.com/books/waste)
  by Catherine Coleman Flowers, a 2020 MacArthur Fellow and environmental health researcher.
  [Write to us](mailto:info@leventhalmap.org) if you have thoughts on the book!"

  content_block_text: What impact did the Revolution era military’s presence in American
    cities have on citizens and civilians? Tune in to hear Professor [John McCurdy](https://www.emich.edu/history-philosophy/history/faculty/j-mccurdy.php)
    unpack the geographies of contact between soldiers and civilians—from urban squares
    to barracks and lodging houses—during the Revolutionary War. McCurdy’s work examines
    the small-scale spaces where the everyday realities of life during an imperial
    conflict became personalized.
