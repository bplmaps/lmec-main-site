      **[Emily Bowe](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/emily-bowe/)**,
      this exhibition prompts questions about how computerization gradually
      entered the world of mapmaking, and will leave you with a new

      communication. As we approach opening day on September 13, read the press
