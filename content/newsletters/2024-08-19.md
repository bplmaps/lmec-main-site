      **[Emily Bowe](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/emily-bowe/)**,
      this exhibition prompts questions about how computerization gradually
      entered the world of mapmaking, and will leave you with a new
      understanding of the relationship between technology, society, and
      communication. As we approach opening day on **September 13**, read the
