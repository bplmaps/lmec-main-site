  - content_block_header: “Boston” versus Boston — what’s the difference?
    content_block_text: >
      In case you missed it, Leventhal Center President & Head Curator Garrett
      Dash Nelson was a guest on the podcast [Explain Boston to
      Me](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/explain-boston-to-me/id1698305199).
      In the episode, he talks about how the term “Boston” can refer both to the
      relatively small city proper and a much larger metro area extending deep
      into New England. The story of these competing Bostons has been shaped by
      factors like Yankee identity, school snobbery, and local taxation.
