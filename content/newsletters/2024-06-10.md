      Virtual: Blue Maps of China: A Conversation with Elze Papelitzky · Monday,
      June 17, 1 pm ET
    content_block_text: >
      The blue terrestrial maps show the Chinese empire of the early nineteenth
      century surrounded by its neighbors such as Japan, Korea, and India.
      Instead of mapping these regions according to their shape, the mapmakers
      added short texts indicating their political relations with the Qing
      state. This virtual talk with **Elze Papelitzky** will focus on how these
      nineteenth-century Chinese mapmakers saw their place in the world, across
      both space and time.

  - content_block_header: Draw Your Own Constellation for Our June Fundraiser
    content_block_text: >
      This June, we're inviting our supporters to rename the heavens by drawing
      and naming your own unique star patterns. Our current exhibition, *[Heaven
      &
      Earth](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/),*
      features Chinese star charts and examines how the heavens were interpreted
      by nineteenth-century Chinese scholars. Just as different cultural
      traditions have made different maps of the stars, we’re asking you to help
      us make our own constellation chart. Support our work today and show off
      your creativity!
