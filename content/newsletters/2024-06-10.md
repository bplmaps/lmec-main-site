      Virtual: Blue Maps of China: A Conversation with Elze Papelitzky Â· Monday,
      June 17, 1 pm ET
    content_block_text: >
      The blue terrestrial maps show the Chinese empire of the early nineteenth
      century surrounded by its neighbors such as Japan, Korea, and India.
      Instead of mapping these regions according to their shape, the mapmakers
      added short texts indicating their political relations with the Qing
      state. This virtual talk with **Elze Papelitzky** will focus on how these
      nineteenth-century Chinese mapmakers saw their place in the world, across
      both space and time.
