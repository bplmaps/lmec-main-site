      A new exhibition on display by our friends, the William L. Clements
      Library at the University of Michigan, *[Bloody Work: Lexington and
      Concord 1775](https://clements.umich.edu/exhibit/bloody-work/)* explores
      the early months of 1775 in Massachusetts, the battles of April 19, and
      their immediate aftermath, giving an account of the events that ignited a
      nearly eight-year Revolutionary War between the British Empire and its
      American colonies. This exhibit features a map very reminiscent of those
      in our *[Terrains of
      Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/)*
      exhibit, most notably *[Thirty-miles round
      Boston](https://www.argomaps.org/maps/commonwealth:8p58wp59k/)* and *[A
      plan of Boston, and its
      environs](https://www.argomaps.org/maps/commonwealth:3f462w352/)*. Be sure
      to check out both exhibits for more information of Massachusetts' role in
      the beginning of the American Revolution.
