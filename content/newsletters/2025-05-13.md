      In-Person · May 16, 2 pm ET · Changed/Forgotten: Places That No Longer
      Exist
    content_block_text: "Every place goes through changes, even the cities, countries, and empires we think will be around until the end of time. Sometimes environmental shifts or disasters bring about a catastrophic collapse. Other times human whims and desires lead to the decimation of historic areas, irreversibly altering the very fabric of the region.\n\nThrough the maps on display in this\_*From The Vault*, we can revisit these places of the past. From the historic counterparts of modern day cities or the ancient ruins of a fallen society,\_*Changed/Forgotten*\_will show us just how much has changed, how much has been forgotten, and yet how much still remains from a time gone by.\n"
