- content_block_header: Making Air Quality Visible for Community Action
  content_block_text: How can community-based participatory research in Chinatown
    and Somerville  build power for environmental justice? Our conversation with Lydia
    Lowe of the [Chinatown Community Land Trust](https://chinatownclt.org/), [Doug
    Brugge](https://facultydirectory.uchc.edu/profile?profileId=Brugge-Douglas) of
    the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, and Ellin Reisner of the [Somerville
    Transportation Equity Partnership](https://www.somervillestep.org/) discussed
    a decade-long partnership between community leaders and academic researchers working
    to improve air quality. We also showed historic maps of the transportation infrastructure
    of these two areas from the 19th century to the present, underscoring the deep
    roots of these air quality challenges.

- content_block_header: Parks and Open Space, 200 Years After Olmsted
  content_block_text: In a recent _New Yorker_ article titled "[The Future of Parks](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-future-of-public-parks)",
    architecture and design critic Alexandra Lange explores the legacy of Frederick
    Law Olmsted through conversations with contemporary landscape architects. She
    contends with the way that parks can breed exclusivity and higher prices that
    are at odds with Olmsted's stated values of public access and democratic urbanism.
    Boston's Emerald Necklace even makes an appearance in the article—see our own
    [recent article](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/celebrating-frederick-law-olmsted/)
    from [Megan Nally](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/megan-nally/) to
    discover maps in our collection that showcase Olmsted's early designs for green
    space in this city.
