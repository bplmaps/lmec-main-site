- content_block_header: Making Air Quality Visible for Community Action
  content_block_text: 'How did community-based participatory research in Chinatown
    help build power for community green space? How did residents of Somerville work
    to get justice for violations of the Clean Air Act? Our conversation with Lydia
    Lowe of the [Chinatown Community Land Trust](https://chinatownclt.org/), [Doug
    Brugge](https://facultydirectory.uchc.edu/profile?profileId=Brugge-Douglas) of
    the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, and Ellin Reisner of the [Somerville
    Transportation Equity Partnership](https://www.somervillestep.org/) helped illuminate
    the story of decade-long partnerships between community leaders and academic researchers
    into air quality affected by highways running through Chinatown & Somerville.
    We also showed historic maps of the transportation infrastructure of these two
    areas in the mid-1800s and early 1900s, underscoring the deep roots of these air
    quality challenges. '

- content_block_header: Parks & open space 200 years after Olmsted
  content_block_text: In an excellent recent article titled "The Future of Parks",
    architecture and design critic Alexandra Lange explores the legacy of Frederick
    Law Olmsted through conversations with contemporary landscape architects. She
    contends with the way that parks can breed exclusivity and higher prices that
    are at odds with Olmsted's stated value of public access. Boston's Emerald Necklace
    even makes an appearance in the article—see the [recent article](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/celebrating-frederick-law-olmsted/)
    from [Megan Nally](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/megan-nally/) for
    maps from our collection that showcase Olmsted's early designs for the linear
    park.
