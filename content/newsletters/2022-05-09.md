- content_block_header: Have ideas for an EJ event series?
  content_block_text: The Boston Public Library has issued a call for community partners
    for programming ideas related to "the environment and the world around us, including
    climate change/justice and environmental activism." Event partners that are selected
    will help craft an event or event series that can use BPL spaces in the Central
    Library and branches and can be partially or fully-funded by the BPL. Applications
    are due on Friday, May 13 â€” please reach out to [programs@bpl.org](mailto:programs@bpl.org
    "mailto:programs@bpl.org") with any questions.
