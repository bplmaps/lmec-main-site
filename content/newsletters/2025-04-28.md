      Earlier this month, the Leventhal Center’s newest exhibition *[Terrains of
      Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/)*
      was featured in Boston Globe columnist Mark Feeney’s article [“1775 and
      all
      that,”](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/09/arts/1775-all-that/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results)
      which spotlighted institutions in and around Boston marking the 250th
      anniversary of the American Revolution with interpretive exhibitions. His
      review praised the maps in the show as ones “that repay study” and
      described the exhibition text as “both informative and insightful.” We
      were honored to share space with exhibitions created by colleagues at the
      [Concord Museum](https://concordmuseum.org/), [Massachusetts Historical
      Society](https://www.masshist.org/), and [Commonwealth
      Museum](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/commonwealth-museum/commonwealth-museum.htm).
      If you’re in or around Boston, we encourage you to check out *Terrains of
      Independence* together with the other three shows!
