      Earlier this month, the Leventhal Center’s newest exhibition *[Terrains of
      Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/)*
      was featured in Boston Globe columnist Mark Feeney’s article [“1775 and
      all
      that,”](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/09/arts/1775-all-that/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results)
      which spotlighted institutions in and around Boston marking the 250th
      anniversary of the American Revolution with interpretive exhibitions. His
      review praised the maps in the show as ones “that repay study” and
      described the exhibition text as “both informative and insightful.” We
      were honored to share space with exhibitions created by colleagues at the
      [Concord Museum](https://concordmuseum.org/), [Massachusetts Historical
      Society](https://www.masshist.org/), and [Commonwealth
      Museum](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/commonwealth-museum/commonwealth-museum.htm).
      If you’re in or around Boston, we encourage you to check out *Terrains of
      Independence* together with the other three shows!

  - content_block_header: 'From the Vault: March + April Roundup'
    content_block_text: >
      This past March and April, we hosted four From the Vault events.


      **[Mapped By Her: The Uncharted Influence of Women in
      Cartography](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-mapped-by-her/)**
      highlighted the women have worked as colorists, engravers, shop owners,
      publishers, and, most importantly, as map-makers themselves. **[As Little
      Land As Possible: Maps of the Oceans &
      Seas](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-as-little-land-as-possible-maps-of-the-oceans-seas/)**
      answered the question “How exactly do you map an area with no land?”
      **[Revolution at Scale: New Netherlands, the Hudson, and
      Albany](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-revolution-at-scale-new-netherlands-the-hudson-and-albany/)**
      used the same scales seen in our exhibition, *[Terrains of
      Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/)*,
      to examine another colonial city—Albany—revealing what we can learn as we
      zoom in from empire to town.


      Our final FTV, **American Revolution in Boston**, was a collaboration with
      the BPL Special Collections. Featuring numerous artifacts from several
      events over Boston’s involvement in the Revolutionary War, this event
      brought in more than 300 people to the Center!


      Check out the maps from each of the events in the roundup articles linked
      below.
