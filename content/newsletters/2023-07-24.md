      It’s been a busy summer here, as we’ve had [five high school and college
      interns](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/welcome-summer-2023-interns/)
      working with us this summer on creating [new layers for
      Atlascope](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/new-layers-in-atlascope/)
      and as we’ve brought on our new Northeastern co-op student, Micaela Kahn,
      serving as our Visitor Services and Exhibition Assistant. If you stop by
      our gallery at the Central Library in the next few months, it’s likely
      Mica who will greet you at the front desk.
