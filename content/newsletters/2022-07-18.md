- content_block_header: Newly digitized maps in our collections portal
  content_block_text: The striking bird's eye view that appears in the header of this
    week's newsletter is taken from a [1903 map of the freight terminals](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:df65xz27g)
    which were redeveloped nearly a century later into the Seaport neighborhood. It's
    just one of hundreds of newly digitized items that we added to our ever-growing
    [Digital Collections portal](https://collections.leventhalmap.org) this week.
    Do you have 10 minutes (or maybe 10 hours) to spare? [Take a browse through the
    newly added collections](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?per_page=50&q=&sort=system_create_dtsi+desc)
    and see what strikes your creativity and curiosity. From a [pictorial map of the
    U.S. food industry](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4q77jf53r)
    created by the Armour meatpacking company to [an 1874 chart of Long Island Sound
    that's more than 8 feet long](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:w6636s756),
    our digital resources offer a treasure trove of interesting material.

- content_block_header: Want to try your hand at remixing the floor map in our gallery?
  content_block_text: Have you wondered what goes in to making an original map for
    a Map Center exhibition? [Emily Bowe](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/emily-bowe/)
    wrote about the process of making a large floor map for the current exhibition
    entitled ["A City of Unequal Risks"](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:4t64k502g)
    that displays data collected as part of the 2016 [Climate Ready Boston report](https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/embed/2/20161207_climate_ready_boston_digital2.pdf).
    As staff engages with visitors and students in the gallery, we love hearing what
    feedback they have on what they might add or change about the map if they were
    the mapmaker. We can't change the map on the floor, so we built a tool that allows
    you to play mapmaker and tweak the existing map in [this interactive](https://map-remix.glitch.me/).
