      Virtual: Urban Space, Water, and Health in Colonial Charleston · Sep 16, 6
      pm ET 
    content_block_text: "Join us this fall for a conversation in the [Brown Seminar on the Historical Geography of the American Revolutionary Era](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/richard-h.-brown-seminar/) with historian **Molly Nebiolo**. Professor Nebiolo\_will explore the colonial geography of Charleston with a focus on tidal creeks and other waterbodies—both those marked on maps of this period as well as those hidden in the cartographic record. These maps open up a new perspective on the history of health and environment in the eighteenth century colonial American city.\n\n*This program is part of the [American Revolutionary Geographies Online (ARGO)](https://www.argomaps.org/) initiative.*\n"
