      Virtual: Urban Space, Water, and Health in Colonial Charleston · Sep 16, 6
      pm ET 
    content_block_text: "Join us this fall for a conversation in the [Brown Seminar on the Historical Geography of the American Revolutionary Era](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/richard-h.-brown-seminar/) with historian **Molly Nebiolo**. Professor Nebiolo\_will explore the colonial geography of Charleston with a focus on tidal creeks and other waterbodies—both those marked on maps of this period as well as those hidden in the cartographic record. These maps open up a new perspective on the history of health and environment in the eighteenth century colonial American city.\n\n*This program is part of the [American Revolutionary Geographies Online (ARGO)](https://www.argomaps.org/) initiative.*\n"

      In-Person: Cartography at Length: The Longest Maps in the Library · August
      8, 2 pm ET
    content_block_text: "If we organized maps by their printed length, would we see patterns emerge? Could we learn something about geography and history from looking at the longest maps in a library? It turns out the answer is “yes.”\n\nIn this\_*From The Vault*, we dive into some of the longest and tallest maps in the Leventhal Center collections. From rivers to railroads, green parks to gold rushes, these maps document how cartographers have fixated on long landscapes—including one 12-foot long map of the Boston Marathon, printed on a receipt!\n"

    content_block_text: >
      We don’t want to rush summer but we *do* love the start of a new school
      year. Our Education team is pleased to welcome K-12 educators—near and
      far—to the next year of upcoming teacher workshops. We will be hosting
      both virtual and in-person sessions where educators can explore a range of
      topics, from teaching map basics in a non-basic way, to engaging with
      complicated conversations around the naming and claiming of space. Sign up
      today to ensure a space in an upcoming program!

  - content_block_header: 'From the Vault Map Collections Showing: July Roundup'
    content_block_text: "This past July, we hosted two *From the Vault* Map Collections Showing events.\n\n***We Are One: Mapping America’s Road from Revolution to Independence*** brought back the best elements of one of our most popular exhibitions,\_[We Are One](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/3), to celebrate this Independence Day and explore the tumultuous events that led thirteen colonies to join and forge a new nation. In\_***Historic Currents: Charting the Evolution of Boston’s Ferry Routes***, we partnered with A Better City,\_the Seaport Transportation Management Association, and the Lower Mystic Transportation Management Association to learn about how transportation hubs, industries, and the destinations characterizing Greater Boston communities led the way for a variety of successful ferry routes.\n\nWe welcome other community and interest groups to collaborate with us on future map collections showings. Please contact Julia Williams, Gallery & Communications Coordinator, at [jwilliams@leventhalmap.org](mailto:jwilliams@leventhalmap.org), if you would like to propose a co-curated program.\n\n**Check out the maps from each of the events in the roundup articles linked below.**\n"
