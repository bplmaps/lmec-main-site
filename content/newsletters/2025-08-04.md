      Virtual: Urban Space, Water, and Health in Colonial Charleston · Sep 16, 6
      pm ET 
    content_block_text: "Join us this fall for a conversation in the [Brown Seminar on the Historical Geography of the American Revolutionary Era](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/richard-h.-brown-seminar/) with historian **Molly Nebiolo**. Professor Nebiolo\_will explore the colonial geography of Charleston with a focus on tidal creeks and other waterbodies—both those marked on maps of this period as well as those hidden in the cartographic record. These maps open up a new perspective on the history of health and environment in the eighteenth century colonial American city.\n\n*This program is part of the [American Revolutionary Geographies Online (ARGO)](https://www.argomaps.org/) initiative.*\n"

Could we learn something about geography and history from looking at the longest maps in a library? It turns out the answer is “yes.”\n\nIn this\_*From The Vault*, we dive into some of the longest and tallest maps in the Leventhal Center collections. From rivers to railroads, green parks to gold rushes, these maps document how cartographers have fixated on long landscapes—including one 12-foot long map of the Boston Marathon, printed on a receipt!\n"
