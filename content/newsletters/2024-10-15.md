    content_block_text: >
      This past summer, undergraduate Geohumanities & GIS interns worked at the
      Leventhal Center to create new layers for Atlascope by geotransforming
      digitized atlases and expanding the current range of cities and towns
      available to the public. 


      Two of the interns, **Carlos Cueva Caro** and **Anna Hsu**, drew on
      Atlascope as a narrative aid to highlight some important histories of
      Boston and Salem. Do you know where Henry James got off the train in
      Salem? Do you know about Melnea Cass’s long history of advocacy and
      activism in Boston that lead to the dedication of “Melnea Cass Boulevard”?
      Find out more about these histories in the two newest Atlascope tours:
      *Beyond the Boulevard* and *After Hawthorne’s Salem*.
