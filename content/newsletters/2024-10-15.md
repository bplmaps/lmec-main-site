  - content_block_header: Summer 2024 Atlascope Tours
    content_block_text: >
      This past summer, undergraduate Geohumanities & GIS interns worked at the
      Leventhal Center to create new layers for Atlascope by geotransforming
      digitized atlases and expanding the current range of cities and towns
      available to the public. 


      Two of the interns, **Carlos Cueva Caro** and **Anna Hsu**, drew on
      Atlascope as a narrative aid to highlight some important histories of
      Boston and Salem. Do you know where Henry James got off the train in
      Salem? Do you know about Melnea Cass’s long history of advocacy and
      activism in Boston that lead to the dedication of “Melnea Cass Boulevard”?
      Find out more about these histories in the two newest Atlascope tours:
      *Beyond the Boulevard* and *After Hawthorne’s Salem*.

    content_block_text: >
      Boston is an ever-evolving city, so it can be difficult to imagine just
      how different Boston looked and functioned over century ago. In this
      two-part article series, friend of the Center, **Gerald A. Rosenthal**,
      explores the history and infrastructure of Boston in 1906 and also uses
      the 1906 film *Seeing Boston* to provide a detailed tour by trolley car
      through the city.


      Interested in historic Boston? Take a look at this curated *From The
      Vault* collections showing organized around the 1906 *Seeing Boston* film.

  - content_block_header: 'Virtual: Martin Brückner · Tuesday, October 22, 7 pm ET'
    content_block_text: >
      Learn about how the consumer revolution of the eighteenth century
      profoundly affected people’s material lives and paved the way for other
      more momentous political revolutions.


      In this program, **Martin Brückner** will discuss how maps—including some
      of the objects included in the [American Revolutionary Geographies
      Online](https://www.argomaps.org/) project—became popular consumer goods
      and how their material transfer as “cartifacts” came to shape everyday and
      political life in early America. Brückner is Professor of English and
      Director of the Winterthur Program in American Material Culture at the
      University of Delaware. This talk is part of the Richard H. Brown Seminar
      on the Historical Geography of the American Revolutionary Era.

      This crop of a 1875 map shows the “pendulum station” drilled into a
      mountain that’s home to one of the most impressive engineering feats of
      nineteenth-century Massachusetts: a 4.75-mile train tunnel that still
      remains in active use today! What is the name of this tunnel?


      * Merrimack Tunnel

      * Hoosac Tunnel

      * Berkshire Tunnel

      * Deerfield Tunnel


      The answer to the last Newsletter Trivia question about when Boston’s
      Great Elm Tree fell is 1876.
