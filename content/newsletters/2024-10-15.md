  - content_block_header: Summer 2024 Atlascope Tours
    content_block_text: >
      This past summer, undergraduate Geohumanities & GIS interns worked at the
      Leventhal Center to create new layers for Atlascope by geotransforming
      digitized atlases and expanding the current range of cities and towns
      available to the public. 


      Two of the interns, **Carlos Cueva Caro** and **Anna Hsu**, drew on
      Atlascope as a narrative aid to highlight some important histories of
      Boston and Salem. Do you know where Henry James got off the train in
      Salem? Do you know about Melnea Cass’s long history of advocacy and
      activism in Boston that lead to the dedication of “Melnea Cass Boulevard”?
      Find out more about these histories in the two newest Atlascope tours:
      *Beyond the Boulevard* and *After Hawthorne’s Salem*.

    content_block_text: >
      Boston is an ever-evolving city, so it can be difficult to imagine just
      how different Boston looked and functioned over century ago. In this
      two-part article series, friend of the Center, **Gerald A. Rosenthal**,
      explores the history and infrastructure of Boston in 1906 and also uses
      the 1906 film *Seeing Boston* to provide a detailed tour by trolley car
      through the city.


      Interested in historic Boston? Take a look at this curated *From The
      Vault* collections showing organized around the 1906 *Seeing Boston* film.
