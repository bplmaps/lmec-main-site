      “These maps don't just reflect how the city used to look: they're also a
      reflection of what technologies were available, and how those technologies
      shaped residents' perceptions of the region,” writes [Christian
      MilNeil](https://mass.streetsblog.org/author/christianmilneil) of
      [Streetsblog](https://mass.streetsblog.org/) in a recent review of our new
      exhibition, *[Getting Around Town: Four Centuries of Mapping Boston in
      Transit](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/)*.
