      In Person: Jake Berman on The Lost Subways of North America · December 20,
      6:00 pm ET
    content_block_text: >
      Can you imagine the would-be subway systems of Cincinnati, Houston, Miami,
      or Richmond? In this talk, cartographer and artist Jake Berman will talk
      about his new book, [The Lost Subways of North America: A Cartographic
      Guide to the Past, Present, and What Might Have
      Been](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo206950010.html).
      Using meticulous archival research, Berman has successfully plotted maps
      of old train networks covering 23 North American cities, ranging from New
      York City’s Civil War-era plan for a steam-powered subway under Fifth
      Avenue to the ultramodern automated Vancouver SkyTrain and the
      thousand-mile electric railway system of prewar Los Angeles. He will
      explore colorful maps of old, often forgotten streetcar lines, lost ideas
      for never-built transit, and modern rail systems—drawing us into the
      captivating transit histories of US and Canadian cities.

      Are you eagerly awaiting the opening of our next exhibition Heaven &
      Earth: The Blue Maps of China? If so, this Map Chat should be your next
      read. This digital interactive compares two maps from the MacLean
      Collection to examine how the Qing Empire was forced to reconceptualize
      its depictions of territory, geography, and sovereignty in the wake of the
      nineteenth-century Opium Wars.

      In partnership with the Osher Map Library and Smith Center for
      Cartographic Education, next summer we will welcome 25 educators (grades
      3-12) to Portland, Maine, and Boston, Massachusetts, from July 14 to July
      26, 2024 for the NEH Summer Institute “Teaching With Maps: Community and
      Resilience in Maritime New England.” Teachers will explore how maps and
      landscapes reflect, erase, obscure, and celebrate Black and Indigenous
      geographies and histories along New England’s maritime coast. Participants
      receive a $2,200 stipend for participating in the two-week program.
