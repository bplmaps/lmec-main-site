      Can you imagine the would-be subway systems of Cincinnati, Houston, Miami,
      or Richmond? In this talk, cartographer and artist Jake Berman will talk
      about his new book, [The Lost Subways of North America: A Cartographic
      Guide to the Past, Present, and What Might Have
      Been](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo206950010.html).
      Using meticulous archival research, Berman has successfully plotted maps
      of old train networks covering 23 North American cities, ranging from New
      York City’s Civil War-era plan for a steam-powered subway under Fifth
      Avenue to the ultramodern automated Vancouver SkyTrain and the
      thousand-mile electric railway system of prewar Los Angeles. He will
      explore colorful maps of old, often forgotten streetcar lines, lost ideas
      for never-built transit, and modern rail systems—drawing us into the
      captivating transit histories of US and Canadian cities.
