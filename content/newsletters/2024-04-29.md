    content_block_text: "Supported by the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/), Chloe Bordewich and Lydia Harrington dive into the history of Boston’s historic Little Syria and demonstrate the longstanding presence of Americans of Arab origin in and around Boston and their contributions to communal life in the city. \n\nBoston’s first Arabic-speaking community was made up of immigrants from Ottoman-controlled Greater Syria who began arriving in the late 1880s. By the early years of the twentieth century, the city was home to a thriving “Little Syria,” also called Syriantown and the Syrian Colony. Today, few visible traces of this neighborhood remain. The\_[Boston Little Syria Project](https://bostonlittlesyria.org/)\_has sought to document its history in collaboration with former residents and their descendants.\n"

  - content_block_header: Touring Boston on the Boston Elevated
    content_block_text: >
      A newly digitized collection of posters created by the Boston Elevated
      Railway is the perfect end to our exhibition [Getting Around
      Town](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/),
      which closed April 27 after an eight-month run. These early
      twentieth-century posters, full of vivid color and charming illustrations,
      advertise sightseeing locations throughout Boston—all of which were
      accessible on public transit! Take a tour with us through the poster
      collection as we follow along on a map of Boston's public transit from
      1927.
