    content_block_text: "Supported by the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/), Chloe Bordewich and Lydia Harrington dive into the history of Boston’s historic Little Syria and demonstrate the longstanding presence of Americans of Arab origin in and around Boston and their contributions to communal life in the city. \n\nBoston’s first Arabic-speaking community was made up of immigrants from Ottoman-controlled Greater Syria who began arriving in the late 1880s. By the early years of the twentieth century, the city was home to a thriving “Little Syria,” also called Syriantown and the Syrian Colony. Today, few visible traces of this neighborhood remain. The\_[Boston Little Syria Project](https://bostonlittlesyria.org/)\_has sought to document its history in collaboration with former residents and their descendants.\n"
