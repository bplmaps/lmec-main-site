    content_block_text: "Supported by the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/), Chloe Bordewich and Lydia Harrington dive into the history of Boston’s historic Little Syria and demonstrate the longstanding presence of Americans of Arab origin in and around Boston and their contributions to communal life in the city. \n\nBoston’s first Arabic-speaking community was made up of immigrants from Ottoman-controlled Greater Syria who began arriving in the late 1880s. By the early years of the twentieth century, the city was home to a thriving “Little Syria,” also called Syriantown and the Syrian Colony. Today, few visible traces of this neighborhood remain. The\_[Boston Little Syria Project](https://bostonlittlesyria.org/)\_has sought to document its history in collaboration with former residents and their descendants.\n"

  - content_block_header: Touring Boston on the Boston Elevated
    content_block_text: >
      A newly digitized collection of posters created by the Boston Elevated
      Railway is the perfect end to our exhibition [Getting Around
      Town](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/),
      which closed April 27 after an eight-month run. These early
      twentieth-century posters, full of vivid color and charming illustrations,
      advertise sightseeing locations throughout Boston—all of which were
      accessible on public transit! Take a tour with us through the poster
      collection as we follow along on a map of Boston's public transit from
      1927.

    content_block_text: >
      From The Vault is a biweekly event series featuring collections objects
      selected by Leventhal Center staff. Each program revolves around a theme
      to explore in the collection, and objects are on display in our Learning
      Center for the afternoon. No registration is required!


      In April, we hosted two From The Vault events focused on the Boston
      Marathon and “Maps as Art.” The former was in collaboration with Boston
      Public Library’s Special Collections Department and our most popular From
      The Vault event so far, with 600 visitors over two days. Take a look at
      what we pulled from the collections in these roundup articles.

    content_block_text: >
      It’s time to say “Goodbye!” to *Getting Around Town: Four Centuries of
      Mapping Boston in Transit*. The exhibition opened in September 2023 and
      tens of thousands patrons have visited in person, drawn their own personal
      transit maps of Boston and beyond, helped track patron commuter data, and
      listened to the tantalizing tale of Charlie on the MTA.


      Though leaving the gallery, the [digital
      exhibition](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/)
      of *Getting Around Town*, with dozens of high-resolution maps, will remain
      available on our website.

  - content_block_header: 'Final Featured Visitor Maps from Getting Around Town '
    content_block_text: >
      If you’ve made an in-person visit to *Getting Around Town*, you may have
      seen our invitation to make your own maps of Boston or other parts of the
      world. Over the course of this exhibit, we’ve gotten to see how creative
      and detailed our patrons have been. We’d like to thank all of the patrons
      that participated in creating over 1,250 maps over the course of the show!


      Now that Getting Around Town has closed, our final staff member, **Garrett
      Dash Nelson**, our President & Head Curator, has chosen these maps as his
      favorite:
