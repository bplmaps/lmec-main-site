  - content_block_header: 'An Interview with Meghan Kelly, LMEC Designer-in-Residence'
    content_block_text: >
      In June 2025, Meghan Kelly will join the Leventhal Center as this year’s
      Designer-in-Residence. Meghan is a cartographer and an associate professor
      in the Geography and the Environment Department at Syracuse University.
      Her work draws on feminist practice and challenges our conventional
      understandings of space and place using new forms of visualization. We sat
      down with Meghan to learn more about how she became a geographer, how she
      thinks about critical cartography, and her upcoming residency at the
      Center.
