  - content_block_header: 'An Interview with Meghan Kelly, LMEC Designer-in-Residence'
    content_block_text: >
      In June 2025, **Meghan Kelly** will join the Leventhal Center as this
      year’s Designer-in-Residence. Meghan is a cartographer and an associate
      professor in the Geography and the Environment Department at Syracuse
      University. Her work draws on feminist practice and challenges our
      conventional understandings of space and place using new forms of
      visualization. We sat down with Meghan to learn more about how she became
      a geographer, how she thinks about critical cartography, and her upcoming
      residency at the Center.

      The Leventhal Center was recently mentioned in Boston Globe columnist
      Renée Loth’s article [“For Greater Boston, a different kind of freedom
      trail”](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/15/opinion/peoples-guide-boston-maps-lawrence/?p1=StaffPage),
      which focuses on the book *[A People’s Guide to Greater
      Boston](https://bostonbook.org/)* and the power of community-focused
      “counter-mapping.” As quotes in the article, Garrett Dash Nelson, our
      President & Head curator, says “One of our goals in bringing maps like
      this into our collections is to encourage people to see maps not just as
      something done to them and their communities.” One of the maps from the
      book,[ *A people's map of Lawrence,
      Massachusetts*](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3n206t74d),
      in the LMEC collection, along with other examples of “counter-maps.”

  - content_block_header: 'Map Chat: Copying Maps in Early Modern East Asia'
    content_block_text: >
      In the newest publication from the MacLean Collection–Leventhal Center Map
      Chat series, **Dr. Mario Cams** investigates how studying one particular
      copy of an eighteenth-century map of the Ming Empire can open up a
      genealogy of printed maps. In his dissection and analysis of the map, Cams
      argues that this map demonstrates a history of print culture that sheds
      light on how East Asian mapmakers recombined and copied features from
      older objects, crossing time and space through Ming China, Qing China, and
      Edo Japan.
