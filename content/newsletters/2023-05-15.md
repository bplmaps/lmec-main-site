    content_block_text: >
      We have some exciting news - our team is **expanding Atlascope** to cover
      even more towns in Massachusetts! We need help from you and your
      communities to make this happen —  transforming a single atlas from
      printed pages into a modern, readable web-layer is both costly and
      time-consuming, taking up to 60 hours of skilled labor. **Do you know
      institutions or groups that would want to sponsor an atlas of their
      town?**
