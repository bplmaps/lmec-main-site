  - content_block_header: Sponsor a Massachusetts Atlas
    content_block_text: >
      We have some exciting news - our team is expanding Atlascope to cover even
      more towns in Massachusetts! We need help from you and your communities to
      make this happen â€”  transforming a single atlas from printed pages into a
      modern, readable web-layer is both costly and time-consuming, taking up to
      60 hours of skilled labor. Do you know institutions or groups that would
      want to sponsor an atlas of their town? Please get in touch.
