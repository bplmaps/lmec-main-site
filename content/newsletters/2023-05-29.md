      A War of Ideology: Reading the Illustrierte Karte through the Lens of
      Geopolitics
    content_block_text: >
      "However, a closer look provides insight into growing American
      geopolitical influence, U.S. interests in defining German perceptions of
      America, and even some insights into how the U.S. state imagined its own
      regionally distinct cultural and economic geographies,” writes geospatial
      intern Joshua Aldwinckle-Povey in a recent article on this [1950s
      German-language map of the United
      States](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp17t).

    content_block_text: "How did Boston’s waterfront geography become a flashpoint for rebellion?

Join us this Tuesday at 7:00pm with scholar\_Benjamin L. Carp\_to learn about these and other insights from a historical geographic approach to the Revolutionary period.\n"

      The Leventhal Center is putting on an [exhibition in May
      2024](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/) based on two large
      Chinese Qing dynasty maps. One represents places on Earth, a terrestrial
      map, and the other the objects in the sky, a celestial map. We are looking
      for three or four young artists from the Boston Public Schools to respond
      to these maps in any media, as long as the artwork meets a few conditions.
      Materials will be provided. Commitment of 34 hours minimum over 8 weeks,
      starting July 6. $500 upon completion of work.
