      A War of Ideology: Reading the Illustrierte Karte through the Lens of
      Geopolitics
    content_block_text: >
      "However, a closer look provides insight into growing American
      geopolitical influence, U.S. interests in defining German perceptions of
      America, and even some insights into how the U.S. state imagined its own
      regionally distinct cultural and economic geographies,” writes geospatial
      intern Joshua Aldwinckle-Povey in a recent article on this [1950s
      German-language map of the United
      States](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp17t).

      In May 2024, the Leventhal Center will open the [Heaven and Earth
      exhibition](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/), which revolves
      around two large Chinese Qing dynasty maps. One represents places on Earth
      (a terrestrial map) and the other the objects in the sky (a celestial
      map). We are looking for several young artists from the Boston Public
      Schools to respond to these maps in any media, with a few guiding
      conditions from our K-12 team. Materials will be provided. Commitment of
      34 hours minimum over 8 weeks, starting July 6. $500 upon completion of
      work.
