      A War of Ideology: Reading the Illustrierte Karte through the Lens of
      Geopolitics
    content_block_text: >
      “At first glance, the 1950s map of the United States depicted
      below—[Illustrierte karte der Vereinigten Staaten von
      Amerika](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:0r96fp17t)—doesn’t
      appear to share much information for American viewers (unless, of course,
      those viewers can read German). However, a closer look provides insight
      into growing American geopolitical influence, U.S. interests in defining
      German perceptions of America, and even some insights into how the U.S.
      state imagined its own regionally distinct cultural and economic
      geographies,” writes geospatial intern Joshua Aldwinckle-Povey in his
      latest article.
