  content_block_text: Earlier this year, students at the [Lilla G. Frederick Pilot
    Middle School](https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/frederick) explored their neighborhoods
    and interviewed business owners, artists, and residents with the support of [Boston
    Preservation Alliance](https://bostonpreservation.org/) and our K-12 Education
    team. We loved seeing this video of what the students learned using [Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/)
    for their research, and we were especially touched by [the students' kind words](https://youtu.be/Ak0nDQpNOe0?t=105).

  content_block_text: 'Every once in a while, we really like to talk shop about maps,
    data, and digital cartography. This [recent interview with Bert Spaan](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/bert-spaan-interview/)
    about our support of his open-source georeferencing tool Allmaps is just one example
    of how much we love to open the hood of our geospatial systems. For the most part,
    we try to keep technical jargon out of our website and newsletter, but we''re
    looking for people who might appreciate the inner mechanics of our digital tools,
    mapmaking, and general tinkering. If that sounds interesting, why not sign up
    for our brand-new monthly GIS newsletter? '

- content_block_text: On Twitter last week, we saw a [fun visualization of airports](https://twitter.com/willy_maps/status/1536132236583518209)
    that looked like a spider crawling across Europe. We love playing around with
    source map technology, so we put together a new version of the same map using
    Massachusetts library locations instead of airports. [Visit the interactive to
