  content_block_text: 'For this edition of _From The Vault_, we’re taking a look at
    textile maps from our collections—embroidered, sewn, needlepoint, and more. Why
    textile maps? We’re celebrating the 12/01 opening of [Soft City](https://justpractice.work/),
    a pop-up exhibition of large-scale textiles that map the urban fabric of Boston.
    Soft City will be on display in our gallery for the month of December to accompany
    our ongoing exhibition, [_More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the
    Human Landscape_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/).'
