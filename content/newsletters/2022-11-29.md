  content_block_text: Join us for a special pop-up as part of our current exhibition
    _More or Less in Common_. From December 1-2828, we're will be displaying _Soft
    City_, recent work from [Amanda Ugorji](https://architecture.mit.edu/people/amanda-ugorji)
    and [Sophie Weston Chien](https://sophiewestonchien.com/about) of local design
    collaborative [**just practice**](https://justpractice.work/). According to the
    artists, “_Soft City_ is a large-scale textile series that maps the urban fabric
    of Black neighborhoods in the Boston area. The tapestries map historic (redlined)
    and contemporary Black neighborhoods, including Roxbury, Dorchester, and East
    Cambridge. The information mapped tells the story of the past, present and future
    of Black residents, and the ecological resilience of the neighborhoods they live
    in.”

  content_block_text: |-
    Why are African Americans so underrepresented when it comes to interest in nature, outdoor recreation, and environmentalism? Join storyteller, cultural geographer, and accidental environmentalist [Carolyn Finney, PhD](https://www.authorsoutside.com/carolyn-finney/) for a discussion that moves beyond the discourse of the environmental justice movement to examine how the natural environment has been understood, commodified, and represented by both white and black Americans. Dr. Finney and Boston Public Library President **David Leonard** will discuss Dr. Finney’s book **_Black Faces, White Spaces: Reimagining the Relationship of African Americans to the Great Outdoors_** (2014)**_._** After the conversation, there will be time for audience Q&A.

    This program will happen both in-person in the Rabb Lecture Hall at the Central Library in Copley Square as well as online over Zoom webinar.
