  content_block_text: "**Add questions here**\n\nJoin us for three in-person book
    group sessions on [**_Catherine Coleman Flowers’ _**](https://www.catherinecolemanflowers.com/)**_Waste_**,
    exploring \"the largely invisible problem of inadequate waste and water sanitation
    infrastructure in rural communities in the United States.” In her book, Coleman
    Flowers—environmental health advocate, 2020 MacArthur Fellow, and rural development
    manager for Bryan Stevenson’s Equal Justice Initiative—unpacks the effects of
    structural poverty and what the struggle to undo it requires.  \n  \nIn conjunction
    with the Map Center’s current exhibition [**_More or Less in Common: Environment
    and Justice in the Human Landscape_**](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/),
    we will look at maps as we read, looking at the ways cartographers create visual
    representations of the unequal burdens of environmental dangers in our communities.
    Sessions will be held on Thursdays from 6:00 to 7:30 on April 21, 28 and May 5."
