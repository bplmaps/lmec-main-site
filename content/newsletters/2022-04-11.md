- content_block_text: What impact did the Revolution era military's presence in American
    cities have on citizens and civilians? Tune in to hear Professor [John McCurdy](https://www.emich.edu/history-philosophy/history/faculty/j-mccurdy.php)
    unpack the geographies of contact between soldiers and civilians—from urban squares
