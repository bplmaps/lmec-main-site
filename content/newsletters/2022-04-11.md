    **Add questions here**

    Join us for three in-person book group sessions on [**Catherine Coleman Flowers’ **](https://www.catherinecolemanflowers.com/)**_Waste_**, exploring "the largely invisible problem of inadequate waste and water sanitation infrastructure in rural communities in the United States.” In her book, Coleman Flowers—environmental health advocate, 2020 MacArthur Fellow, and rural development manager for Bryan Stevenson’s Equal Justice Initiative—unpacks the effects of structural poverty and what the struggle to undo it requires.

    In conjunction with the Map Center’s current exhibition [**_More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape_**](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/), we will look at maps as we read, looking at the ways cartographers create visual representations of the unequal burdens of environmental dangers in our communities. Sessions will be held on Thursdays from 6:00 to 7:30 on April 21, 28 and May 5.

- content_block_text: What impact did the Revolution era military's presence in American
    cities have on citizens and civilians? Tune in to hear Professor [John McCurdy](https://www.emich.edu/history-philosophy/history/faculty/j-mccurdy.php)
    unpack the geographies of contact between soldiers and civilians—from urban squares
    to barracks and lodging houses—during the Revolutionary War. McCurdy’s work examines
    the small-scale spaces where the everyday realities of life during an imperial
    conflict became personalized.
