      See the World of the Early American Republic Through the Work of Women
      Mapmakers
    content_block_text: "Starting in the 1830s, more and more women became part of a quickly growing group who were intimately involved in mapping the natural landscapes, built environments, and geology of the new American Republic. Working as illustrators, cartographers, and colorists, as well as map sellers, engravers, publishers, and globe makers, their work was often marketed as straightforward educational material. But their work profoundly shaped American science, culture, and politics, from views of the country’s natural resources to new ideas about the age and structural makeup of the earth. This digital essay by **Allison Fulton** was supported by the the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/) program.\n"
