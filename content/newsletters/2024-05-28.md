      See the World of the Early American Republic Through the Work of Women
      Mapmakers
    content_block_text: "Starting in the 1830s, more and more women became part of a quickly growing group who were intimately involved in mapping the natural landscapes, built environments, and geology of the new American Republic. Working as illustrators, cartographers, and colorists, as well as map sellers, engravers, publishers, and globe makers, their work was often marketed as straightforward educational material. But their work profoundly shaped American science, culture, and politics, from views of the country’s natural resources to new ideas about the age and structural makeup of the earth. This digital essay by **Allison Fulton** was supported by the the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/) program.\n"

  - content_block_header: 'Civic Data Literacy for Libraries: Still Time to Apply!'
    content_block_text: >
      The Leventhal Center has partnered with [Civic
      Switchboard](https://civic-switchboard.github.io/) to host a two-day
      workshop (June 27–28) at the Boston Public Library on understanding “civic
      data,” or data that describes community life and the decision-making and
      policies that affect people and places. Civic data can include not only
      data produced by governmental organizations, but also non-profits, civic
      institutions (like libraries!), and other community-based organizations.


      Led by members of the Civic Switchboard team with support from LMEC staff,
      this workshop will bring together 20 library workers who use civic data or
      who are interested in developing new civic data roles and projects at
      their institutions. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis
      until the Institute is full. Please direct questions to LMEC’s [Ian
      Spangler](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/ian-spangler/).
