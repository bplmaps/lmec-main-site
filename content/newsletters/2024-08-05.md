  - content_block_header: 'Map Chat: “Encoded Toponyms” in Chinese Administrative Maps'
    content_block_text: >
      If you’ve seen *[Heaven &
      Earth](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/)*,
      either in person or online, a quick look at the [large blue folding screen
      on
      display](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wh24b054q)
      may have you believing that it’s more art than map. (Our staff has lots to
      say on that false binary, but that's for a different newsletter!) Take a
      closer look, though, and you’ll notice small symbols blanketing the
      surface of the map. The symbols, also known as “encoded toponyms,” provide
      detailed information about the administrative structure of Qing Dynasty
      China. In [this new Map
      Chat](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/encoded-toponyms/),
      guest curator **Dr. Richard Pegg** breaks down the meanings of each
      encoded toponym, and explains their unique contribution to the history of
      mapping information.

  - content_block_header: Two-Week LMEC Teacher Institute Recap
    content_block_text: >
      In mid-July, members of LMEC’s education team helped facilitate a two-week
      teacher workshop on Indigenous and Black historical geography along New
      England's maritime coast, in partnership with the [Osher Map Library and
      Smith Center for Cartographic Education](https://oshermaps.org/) in
      Portland, Maine. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities
      (NEH), the Institute brought together 25 educators from across the
      country, across grade levels and disciplines, to participate in
      place-based learning, seminars, and workshops. For more about the
      experience of LMEC educators during the NEH Institute, read the blog post
      below.
