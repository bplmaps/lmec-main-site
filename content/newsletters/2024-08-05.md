    content_block_text: >
      If you’ve seen [Heaven &
      Earth](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/),
      either in person or online, a quick look at the [large blue folding screen
      on
      display](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:wh24b054q)
      may have you believing that it’s more art than map. (Our staff has lots to
      say on that false binary, but that's for a different newsletter!) Take a
      closer look, though, and you’ll notice small symbols blanketing the
      surface of the map. The symbols, also known as “encoded toponyms,” provide
      detailed information about the administrative structure of Qing Dynasty
      China. In [this new Map
      Chat](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/encoded-toponyms/),
      guest curator Dr. Richard Pegg breaks down the meanings of each encoded
      toponym, and explains their unique contribution to the history of mapping
      information.
