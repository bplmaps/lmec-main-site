  - content_block_header: The Brownies’ Book in Boston
    content_block_text: "Supported by the Leventhal Center’s [Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/) program, Tieanna Graphenreed expanded on her dissertation research to build an [interactive map](https://felt.com/map/The-Brownies-Book-in-Greater-Boston-and-Surrounding-Areas-1920-1921-HlZyiiysRfqHH9CtBXm8bxB?loc=42.821,-71.739,6.91z&share=1) of *The Brownies' Book* in Boston. It offers a picture of the people, places, and events in Massachusetts—and especially the Greater Boston area—that were important in shaping emergent curriculum about Black histories in a post-WWI US education system. The map also illustrates the geographies of children and education  in Greater Boston, by documenting the schools attended by readers of *The Brownies' Book*, their neighborhoods, and their places of work."

  - content_block_header: 'From The Vault: February Highlights'
    content_block_text: >
      *From The Vault* is a biweekly event series featuring collections objects
      selected by Leventhal Center staff. Each program revolves around a theme
      to explore in the collection, and objects are on display in our Learning
      Center for the afternoon. No registration is required.


      In February, we hosted two *From The Vault* events: African American History
      and Literary Landscapes. Take a look at what we pulled from the
      collections in these roundup articles, and make sure to drop in to [our
      upcoming *From the Vault*
      programs](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/from-the-vault/).

  - content_block_header: 'Featured Visitor Maps from Getting Around Town '
    content_block_text: >
      If you’ve made an in-person visit to *Getting Around Town*, you may have
      seen our invitation to make your own maps of Boston or other parts of the
      world. We’ve gotten to see how creative and detailed our patrons have been
      and we’d like to show off some of our staff favorite maps from the
      exhibition!


      These featured maps— a map of the Bay Area, California Map by Vaish Sridharan and a map of a daily commute by Annie—were chosen by Rachel Sharer, our Development and
      Grants Manager.
