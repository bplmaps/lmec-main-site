  One of the most wonderful things about maps is that they can take you on
  journeys of discovery both near at hand and across the world—or even beyond
  it. We just concluded an exhibition that brought gallery visitors deep into
  Boston through [an exploration of public transit
  systems](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/).
  Now, we’re taking you farther afield, to nineteenth century China and out into
  celestial space, with our newest exhibition [Heaven & Earth: The Blue Maps of
  China](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/).
  We’ve never had a show quite like Heaven & Earth at the Leventhal Center
  before, and the astonishing large-format “blue maps” that are now center stage
  in our gallery offer a stunning reminder of the visual and conceptual
  diversity of mapmaking across space and time. We hope you’ll [visit
  soon](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/visit/)!

    content_block_text: "When you think of East Asian works of art and the color blue, your mind might jump to Hokusai and The Great Wave off Kanagawa. But it turns out that some of the earliest works from this part of the world to use the Prussian blue colorant were maps!\n\nFrom May 11 to August 31, you can see some of these maps at the Leventhal Center in our special exhibition *[Heaven & Earth: The Blue Maps of China](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/)*. This exhibition centers around two colossal maps created in China during the Qing Dynasty—and tells a global story of how they came to be made. The exhibition is guest curated by **Dr. Richard Pegg**, Director and Curator\_of the MacLean Collection in Chicago, IL. Admission is free.\n"
