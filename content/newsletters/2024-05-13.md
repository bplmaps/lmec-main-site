  One of the most wonderful things about maps is that they can take you on
  journeys of discovery both near at hand and across the world—or even beyond
  it. We just concluded an exhibition that brought gallery visitors deep into
  Boston through [an exploration of public transit
  systems](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/).
  Now, we’re taking you farther afield, to nineteenth century China and out into
  celestial space, with our newest exhibition *[Heaven & Earth: The Blue Maps of
  China](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/)*.
  We’ve never had a show quite like Heaven & Earth at the Leventhal Center
  before, and the astonishing large-format “blue maps” that are now center stage
  in our gallery offer a stunning reminder of the visual and conceptual
  diversity of mapmaking across space and time. We hope you’ll [visit
  soon](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/visit/)!

    content_block_text: "When you think of East Asian works of art and the color blue, your mind might jump to Hokusai and The Great Wave off Kanagawa. But it turns out that some of the earliest works from this part of the world to use the Prussian blue colorant were maps!\n\nFrom May 11 to August 31, you can see some of these maps at the Leventhal Center in our special exhibition *[Heaven & Earth: The Blue Maps of China](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/)*. This exhibition centers around two colossal maps created in China during the Qing Dynasty—and tells a global story of how they came to be made. The exhibition is guest curated by **Dr. Richard Pegg**, Director and Curator\_of the MacLean Collection in Chicago, IL. Admission is free.\n"

  - content_block_header: Within The Body & Beyond It
    content_block_text: "Supported by the Leventhal Center’s\_*[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/)*, essayist **Ilana Bean** explores the shared lineage between cartography and anatomy, and why that relationship still matters today.\n\nFor hundreds of years, distortion has informed how we view the world beyond us as well as the worlds inside us, too. “Cartographers and anatomists both create an unnatural image,” writes Bean, “in order to understand the real.” Comparing maps from the Leventhal Center with medical illustrations, Bean shows how the notorious Mercator projection has a lot more in common with representations of the human muscular system than you might expect. Depictions of the body use many of the same techniques—such as distortions in size and scale—as depictions of the earth, with implications for how we understand politics, medicine, and even life itself.\n"

  - content_block_header: '“Civic Data Literacy for Libraries”: Still Time to Apply!'
    content_block_text: >
      The Leventhal Center has partnered with [Civic
      Switchboard](https://civic-switchboard.github.io/) to host a 2-day
      workshop (June 27-28) at the Boston Public Library on understanding “civic
      data,” or data that describes community life and the decision-making and
      policies that affect people and places. Civic data can include not only
      data produced by governmental organizations, but also non-profits, civic
      institutions (like libraries!), and other community-based organizations.


      Led by members of the Civic Switchboard team with support from LMEC staff,
      this workshop will bring together 20 library workers who use civic data or
      who are interested in developing new civic data roles and projects at
      their institutions. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis
      until the Institute is full. Please direct questions to LMEC’s **[Ian
      Spangler](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/ian-spangler/)**.
