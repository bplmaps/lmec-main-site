      Processing Place: How Computers and Cartographers Redrew our World -
      Coming in September 2024
    content_block_text: >
      In September, we’ll open Processing Place: How Computers and Cartographers
      Redrew our World, an exhibition which explores the ways computers have
      fundamentally changed how cartographers create, interpret, and share
      spatial data to make maps. Curated by LMEC staff Ian Spangler and Emily
      Bowe, this exhibition features objects from the Leventhal Center’s unique
      collections in the history of digital mapping since the 1960s and invites
      visitors to recognize the significant impacts of digital mapping for
      environmental management, law and policy, navigation, national defense,
      social change, and much more.

  - content_block_header: 'From The Vault: March Highlights'
    content_block_text: >
      From The Vault is a biweekly event series featuring collections objects
      selected by Leventhal Center staff. Each program revolves around a theme
      to explore in the collection, and objects are on display in our Learning
      Center for the afternoon. No registration is required!


      In March, we hosted three From The Vault events: Women in Cartography,
      Bird’s Eye View, and Bus Routes of Boston, the latter in collaboration
      with the transit advocacy group
      [TransitMatters](https://transitmatters.org/). Take a look at what we
      pulled from the collections in these roundup articles, and make sure to
      drop in to [our upcoming From the Vault
      programs](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/from-the-vault/).

  - content_block_header: 'Featured Visitor Maps from Getting Around Town '
    content_block_text: >
      If you’ve made an in-person visit to Getting Around Town, you may have
      seen our invitation to make your own maps of Boston or other parts of the
      world. We’ve gotten to see how creative and detailed our patrons have been
      and we’d like to show off some of our staff favorite maps from the
      exhibition!


      A staff member will feature their favorite maps in every newsletter going
      forward through to the end of the exhibition. Check back on social media
      or in future newsletters to see if your map made it to our feature!


      These featured maps were chosen by Ian Spangler, our Assistant Curator of
      Digital & Participatory Geography:
