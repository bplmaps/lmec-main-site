    content_block_text: >
      On March 29, we collaborated with
      **[TransitMatters](https://transitmatters.org/)** to guest curate our
      biweekly From The Vault series.


      In addition to selecting maps from our collection, TransitMatters staff
      also wrote captions detailing the importance of each piece to the past and
      future of Boston’s bus networks. This event was our most successful From
      The Vault event so far of 2024 and brought in over 70 visitors to chat
      with Leventhal and TransitMatters staff about the city’s evolution over
      time, modern public transit, and the woes of “[bus
      bunching](https://dashboard.transitmatters.org/bus/trips/single/?busRoute=1\&date=2024-04-04\&from=1-1-67\&to=1-1-62).”

  - content_block_header: 'Our Last Public Event for Getting Around Town · Tuesday, April 16 6pm ET'
    content_block_text: "In our Spring 2024 conversation series\_Routes Ahead of Us, we take the themes of our current exhibition\_*[Getting Around Town: Mapping Four Centuries of Boston in Transit](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/)*\_and connect the history of Boston’s transit system with questions about how to build a better, more equitable urban mobility system in the future.\n\nThese informal presentations feature discussions with transit and mobility experts, free drinks and refreshments at the Boston Public Library’s Newsfeed Café, and tours of*\_Getting Around Town*\_following the conclusion of the program.\n\nIn the second event of this series, we’ll be speaking to **Dan Rosengard**, the Executive Director of Transportation for Boston Public Schools. In this role, he is focused on ensuring the delivery of safe, reliable, on-time, and cost-effective yellow bus transportation to and from school for over 22,000 Boston students on a daily basis.\n"

  - content_block_header: Officially Introducing Heaven & Earth
    content_block_text: >
      As the opening date of *[Heaven & Earth: The Blue Maps of
      China](\[https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/heaven-and-earth/])*
      approaches, we invite you to delve further into the history and beauty of
      the two Prussian blue maps that inspired guest curator, **Richard Pegg**,
      and have never been exhibited together—before now.


      *Heaven & Earth* puts these two maps into the context of China during the
      Qing Dynasty, and reveals them as unique in the global history of
      mapmaking. The exhibition will debut on May 11, 2024 at the Leventhal Map
      & Education Center.

      patrons have been and we’d like to show off some of our staff favorite
