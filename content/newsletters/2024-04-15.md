    content_block_text: "In our Spring 2024 conversation series\_Routes Ahead of Us, we take the themes of our current exhibition\_[Getting Around Town: Mapping Four Centuries of Boston in Transit](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/)\_and connect the history of Boston’s transit system with questions about how to build a better, more equitable urban mobility system in the future.\n\nThese informal presentations feature discussions with transit and mobility experts, free drinks and refreshments at the Boston Public Library’s Newsfeed Café, and tours of\_Getting Around Town\_following the conclusion of the program.\n\nIn the second event of this series, we’ll be speaking to Dan Rosengard, the Executive Director of Transportation for Boston Public Schools. In this role, he is focused on ensuring the delivery of safe, reliable, on-time, and cost-effective yellow bus transportation to and from school for over 22,000 Boston students on a daily basis.\n"
