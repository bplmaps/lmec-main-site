    content_block_text: >
      Weâ€™re excited to introduce Kiana Harriel to the LMEC team as our new
      Experiential Learning & Programs Educator in the expanding Education
      department! Kiana joined us this June, having recently finished her
      Masters in Teaching Social Studies from Brown University. We sat down with
      Kiana to learn more about her earliest memory of maps, her past teaching
      experience, and her (current) favorite map in the collection.
