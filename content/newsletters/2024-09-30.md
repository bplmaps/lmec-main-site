      Congratulations are in order for 2023 Leventhal Center
      Designer-in-Residence **Andrew Woodruff**, whose work will appear in the
      newest volume of the *[Atlas of Design](https://atlasofdesign.org/)*. The
      selected map, titled *[East Boston Sea Level Rise Flood
      Risk](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1z40px27t)*,
      was created during Andy’s residency at the Leventhal Center. The map
      borrows the visual style of the historic urban atlases that appear in
      [Atlascope](http://atlascope.org/), but updates the content to reflect
      modern climate change flood risks, rather than fire risks.

      Virtual: Richard H. Brown Seminar Series - Martin Brückner · Tuesday,
      October 22, 7 pm ET
    content_block_text: >
      Learn about how the consumer revolution of the eighteenth century
      profoundly affected people’s material lives and paved the way for other
      more momentous political revolutions.


      In this program, **Martin Brückner** will discuss how maps—such as many of
      those shown in [American Revolutionary Geographies
      Online](https://www.argomaps.org/)—became popular consumer goods and how
      their material transfer as “cartifacts” came to shape everyday and
      political life in early America. Brückner is Professor of English and
      Director of the Winterthur Program in American Material Culture at the
      University of Delaware.

      The Great Elm was a feature on the Boston Common grounds and was estimated
      to have been there since the park’s founding in the 1630s. One unfortunate
      day, the iconic tree was toppled during a harsh storm! What year did
      Boston’s Great Elm tree fall?

      This 1958 map published for the Automobile Manufacturers Association makes
      you want to hit the road—in a big rig. Showing "America's Products and the
      Trucks That Carry Them,” this pictorial map is a celebration of the
      American economy at a time of expansion and growth, coupled with an
      illustrated guide to the many kinds of trucks that were beginning to fill
      the highways of the midcentury United States.
