      Congratulations are in order for 2023 Leventhal Center
      Designer-in-Residence **Andrew Woodruff**, whose work will appear in the
      newest volume of the *[Atlas of Design](https://atlasofdesign.org/)*. The
      selected map, titled *[East Boston Sea Level Rise Flood
      Risk](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1z40px27t)*,
      was created during Andy’s residency at the Leventhal Center. The map
      borrows the visual style of the historic urban atlases that appear in
      [Atlascope](http://atlascope.org/), but updates the content to reflect
      modern climate change flood risks, rather than fire risks.

      Curious to see what Boston looked like at the turn of the twentieth
      century? During this edition of *From the Vault*, we’ll have the iconic
      1906 film *Seeing Boston* playing in our classroom, accompanied by maps
      and other objects from BPL Special Collections that help animate the
      places seen in the film.

      Virtual: Richard H. Brown Seminar Series - Martin Brückner · Tuesday,
      October 22, 7 pm ET
    content_block_text: >
      Learn about how the consumer revolution of the eighteenth century
      profoundly affected people’s material lives and paved the way for other
      more momentous political revolutions.


      In this program, **Martin Brückner** will discuss how maps—such as many of
      those shown in [American Revolutionary Geographies
      Online](https://www.argomaps.org/)—became popular consumer goods and how
      their material transfer as “cartifacts” came to shape everyday and
      political life in early America. Brückner is Professor of English and
      Director of the Winterthur Program in American Material Culture at the
      University of Delaware.
