      Congratulations are in order for 2023 Leventhal Center
      Designer-in-Residence **Andrew Woodruff**, whose work will appear in the
      newest volume of the *[Atlas of Design](https://atlasofdesign.org/)*. The
      selected map, titled *[East Boston Sea Level Rise Flood
      Risk](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1z40px27t)*,
      was created during Andy’s residency at the Leventhal Center. The map
      borrows the visual style of the historic urban atlases that appear in
      [Atlascope](http://atlascope.org/), but updates the content to reflect
      modern climate change flood risks, rather than fire risks.
