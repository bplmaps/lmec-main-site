    content_block_text: >
      If you’ve ever visited our gallery, you’ll know that on the walk up to the
      front doors you’ll see a large touchscreen displaying a unique view of the
      Boston Public Library. This past spring, undergraduate interns worked with
      the Center to create new layers for Atlascope, georeferencing digitized
      atlases and working to expanding the current range of cities and towns
      displayed in the tool. We asked our interns to create Atlascope tours of
      subjects they discovered through their georeferencing work and we couldn’t
      be more excited to share the results with you!
