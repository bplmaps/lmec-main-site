      We’re excited to introduce Claire Tratnyek to the LMEC team as the
      Learning Resource Specialist in our expanding Education department! Claire
      joined us this June and is currently finishing her dissertation research
      in Northeastern University’s Department of History. We sat down with
      Claire to learn more about her interests, future work at the Center, and
      her favorite part of the gallery.
