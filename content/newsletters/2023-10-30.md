  - content_block_header: 'In Case You Missed It: Veronica O. Davis on Inclusive Transportation'
    content_block_text: >
      Last Tuesday, Assistant Director Emily Bowe spoke with Veronica O. Davis,
      a civil engineer, urban planner, transportation nerd, and author of
      [Inclusive Transportation: A Manifesto for Repairing Divided
      Communities](https://islandpress.org/books/inclusive-transportation).
      Davis used maps to show the inequitable and often destructive practice of
      transportation planning while offering principles for how to build a more
      inclusive system in the future.
