      Opening Reception for Processing Place: How Computers and Cartographers
      Redrew our World · Tuesday, September 17, 6 pm ET
    content_block_text: >
      Please join us for a special reception as we open the Leventhal Map &
      Education Center's newest exhibition *[Processing Place: How Computers and
      Cartographers Redrew our
      World](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/)*.
      The opening event will feature gallery tours, a discussion with curators
      **Ian Spangler** and **Emily Bowe**, and light refreshments. Most of the
      maps and cartographic tools from the 1960s-1990s on display in this show
      have never been on public display. And if you can't make it to the formal
      opening, [visit our
      gallery](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/visit/) once the show
      officially opens to the public on September 13.

    content_block_text: "This summer, the Leventhal Center’s Geohumanities & GIS interns helped expand [Atlascope](https://www.atlascope.org/) by digitizing new urban atlas layers, researching geospatial datasets that could be combined with it, and writing their own interpretive Atlascope tours.\_Simone Tricca\_and\_Anna Zhang—two of the Geohumanities & GIS interns in the summer cohort—reflect on their time at the LMEC and the impact of their work.\n"
