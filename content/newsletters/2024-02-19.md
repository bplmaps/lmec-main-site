      In our most recent [Cartography
      Challenge](https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/cartography-challenge/),
      we asked mapmakers to dream up other versions of Boston’s transit system.
      We received 11 amazing maps—but we need your help to decide on a favorite!


      The winner of the People’s Choice award will receive a $50 prize. Voting
      can only be done in person, so come check out the submissions at the
      Leventhal Center’s gallery and cast your vote for the “People’s Choice”
      award! Voting will be open until February 23.
