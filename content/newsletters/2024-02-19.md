      In our most recent [Cartography
      Challenge](https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/cartography-challenge/),
      we asked mapmakers to dream up other versions of Boston’s transit system.
      We received 11 amazing maps—but we need your help to decide on a favorite!


      The winner of the People’s Choice award will receive a $50 prize. Voting
      can only be done in person, so come check out the submissions at the
      Leventhal Center’s gallery and cast your vote for the “People’s Choice”
      award! Voting will be open until February 23.

      TransitMatters Virtual Webinar: Transportation Advocacy and the Data
      Dashboard
    content_block_text: >
      Join us for a virtual event with TransitMatters on February 21 7-8 pm ET,
      as they discuss their award-winning Data Dashboard tool, and the impact
      that open data has had on transportation advocacy nationwide. 


      Since its founding, TransitMatters has focused on helping Greater Boston
      advocate for the safe, frequent, and reliable transit. The TransitMatters
      Labs Team drives transportation advocacy by building tools with MBTA data
      to engage the public and increase transparency. 


      The Data Dashboard has played a prominent role in increasing awareness
      about slow zones throughout the MBTA network. Learn more about how this
      tool was built and discuss future possibilities for civic data design.
