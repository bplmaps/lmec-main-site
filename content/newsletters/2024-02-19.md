      TransitMatters Virtual Webinar: Transportation Advocacy and the Data
      Dashboard
    content_block_text: >
      Join us for a virtual event with TransitMatters on February 21 7-8 pm ET,
      as they discuss their award-winning Data Dashboard tool, and the impact
      that open data has had on transportation advocacy nationwide.


      Since its founding, TransitMatters has focused on helping Greater Boston
      advocate for the safe, frequent, and reliable transit. The TransitMatters
      Labs Team drives transportation advocacy by building tools with MBTA data
      to engage the public and increase transparency.


      The Data Dashboard has played a prominent role in increasing awareness
      about slow zones throughout the MBTA network. Learn more about how this
      tool was built and discuss future possibilities for civic data design.

    content_block_text: >
      This summer we will welcome 25 educators in grades 3-12 to Portland,
      Maine, and Boston, Massachusetts, from July 14 to July 26, 2024 for the
      NEH Summer Institute “Teaching With Maps: Community and Resilience in
      Maritime New England,” in partnership with the Osher Map Library and Smith
      Center for Cartographic Education.


      During the two-week program, teachers will explore how maps and landscapes
      reflect, erase, obscure, and celebrate Black and Indigenous geographies
      and histories along New England’s maritime coast. All participants will
      receive a $2,200 stipend for completing the NEH Summer Institute.
      Applications will close on March 5.

  - content_block_header: 'A Re-Named Map of Boston’s Subway Stations: A Social Media Sensation'
    content_block_text: >
      Throughout the month of November 2023, we asked our supporters to help us
      out with a creative and collaborative map project: renaming Boston’s
      subway stations. Donors were able to bid on the “rights” to re-name
      various stations on the Red, Orange, Green and Blue lines and we think
      they did a great job of capturing the spirit of each station!


      In late January, we released the map to the public and were taken aback by
      the level of community support. One of our most popular posts to date,
      Bostonians around the city liked, reposted, and commented all about their
      favorite new names for the stations ("Tulane of the North” for Harvard
      Square on the Red Line and “Screech from the Heavens” for Boylston Street
      were some of the most popular). In the days after releasing the full map,
      we were visited by news crews from The Boston Globe, 7News, Boston 25
      News, and WBZ with many other local stations writing about our map! We
      were so delighted to see such an outpouring of community support for the
      project and would like to thank all of the contributors to the map so much
      for taking part in such an impactful project.

    content_block_text: >
      If you’ve made an in-person visit to *Getting Around Town*, you may have
      seen our invitation to make your own maps of Boston or other parts of the
      world. We’ve gotten to see how creative and detailed our patrons have been
      and we’d like to show off some of our staff favorite maps from the
      exhibition.


      A staff member will feature their favorite maps in every newsletter going
      forward through to the end of the exhibition. Check back on social media
      or in future newsletters to see if your map made it to our feature!


      These featured maps were chosen by **Emily Bowe**, our Assistant Director:


      **Map of a new proposed MBTA line - The Aqua Line by Dave**


      **Map of an Alaskan Airlines flight from San Diego, CA to Boston, MA**
