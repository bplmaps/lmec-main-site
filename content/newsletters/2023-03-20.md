  content_block_text: What can a visualization of population growth tell us about
    different moments in New England's economic geography? In his latest article,
    [Garrett Dash Nelson](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/garrett-nelson/)
    analyzes eras of New England’s economic and urban geography by using [spatial
    patterns of population growth](https://bookworm.benschmidt.org/sappingattention/population-density-2-old-and-new-new/)
    in Census records from 1790 to 2010. Can you guess which MA towns ranked amongst
    the largest cities in the entire nation at the time of the first Census?

    Bostonians are familiar with it. Drawing from photographs, property maps, and
    memoirs of Syrian- and Lebanese-Americans, this exhibition by Lydia Harrington
    and Chloe Bordewich (two awardees of our [2022-2023 Small Grants Program](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/))
    narrates the history of a neighborhood which is nearly invisible today. _On display
    at MIT Rotch library through March 31._
