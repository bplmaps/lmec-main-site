    different moments in New England's economic geography? In his latest article,
    [Garrett Dash Nelson](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/garrett-nelson/)

    patterns of population growth](https://bookworm.benschmidt.org/sappingattention/population-density-2-old-and-new-new/)
    in Census records from 1790 to 2010. Can you guess which Massachusetts towns ranked

    Bostonians are familiar with it. Drawing from photographs, property maps, and
    memoirs of Syrian- and Lebanese-Americans, this exhibition by Lydia Harrington
    and Chloe Bordewich (two awardees of our [2022-2023 Small Grants Program](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/))
    narrates the history of a neighborhood which is nearly invisible today. _On display
    at MIT Rotch library through March 31._
