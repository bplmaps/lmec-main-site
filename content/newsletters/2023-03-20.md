- content_block_header: '"Visualizing Little Syria" on Display at MIT '
  content_block_text: Boston’s [Little Syria](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/topics/creating-communities/)
    thrived between the 1880s and 1950s in today’s Chinatown and South End, yet few
    Bostonians are familiar with it. Drawing from photographs, property maps, and
    memoirs of Syrian- and Lebanese-Americans, this exhibition by Lydia Harrington
    and Chloe Bordewich (two awardees of our [2022-2023 Small Grants Program](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/))
    narrates the history of a neighborhood which is nearly invisible today. _On display
    at MIT Rotch library through March 31._
