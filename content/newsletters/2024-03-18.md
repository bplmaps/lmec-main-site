    content_block_text: >
      [Atlascope](https://www.atlascope.org/) continues to grow across
      Massachusetts, adding geographical coverage and making it possible to
      explore the history of ever more cities and towns. Right now we’re working
      to expand coverage to [Weymouth, Braintree, and
      Quincy](https://leventhalmap.donorsupport.co/page/weymouth-quincy-braintree).
      We need help from you and your communities to make this happen!


      Each atlas requires a complicated, labor-intensive process to transform it
      into an easy-to-use digital map layer. Community support is crucial to
      support this work. Right now, we’re almost [halfway towards our
      goal](https://leventhalmap.donorsupport.co/page/weymouth-quincy-braintree)
      of bringing the first batch of Weymouth, Braintree, and Quincy atlases
      into Atlascope.There are dozens more cities and towns that we hope to add
      in the future. To support a fundraising campaign for your own location,

      [Getting Around
