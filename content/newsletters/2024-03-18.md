      **[Atlascope](https://www.atlascope.org/)** continues to grow across
      Massachusetts, adding geographical coverage and making it possible to
      explore the history of ever more cities and towns. Right now we’re working
      to expand coverage to [Weymouth, Braintree, and
      Quincy](https://leventhalmap.donorsupport.co/page/weymouth-quincy-braintree).
      We need help from you and your communities to make this happen!


      Each atlas requires a complicated, labor-intensive process to transform it
      into an easy-to-use digital map layer. Community support is crucial to
      support this work. Right now, we’re almost [halfway towards our
      goal](https://leventhalmap.donorsupport.co/page/weymouth-quincy-braintree)
      of bringing the first batch of Weymouth, Braintree, and Quincy atlases
      into Atlascope.There are dozens more cities and towns that we hope to add
      in the future. To support a fundraising campaign for your own location,

    content_block_text: "In our Spring 2024 conversation series *Routes Ahead of Us*, we take the themes of our current exhibition [*Getting Around Town: Mapping Four Centuries of Boston in Transit*](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/) and connect the history of Boston’s transit system with questions about how to build a better, more equitable urban mobility system in the future.\n\nThese informal presentations feature discussions with transit and mobility experts, free drinks and refreshments at the Boston Public Library’s Newsfeed Café, and tours of *Getting Around Town* following the conclusion of the program.\n\nIn the second event of this series, we’ll be speaking to **Dan Rosengard**, the Executive Director of Transportation for Boston Public Schools. In this role, he is focused on ensuring the delivery of safe, reliable, on-time, and cost-effective yellow bus transportation to and from school for over 22,000 Boston students on a daily basis.\n"

      Beaucher
    content_block_text: >
      Earlier this month, LMEC hosted **Steven Beaucher**, the guest curator of
      [*Getting Around
      Town*](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/)
      for a live walkthrough and commentary of the exhibition. During the live
      tour, Steven spoke about the origins of public transit in Boston, the
      swift move from horse-drawn omnibuses to electrical trolleys, and the
      creation of the MBTA’s iconic “T” symbol.
