    content_block_text: >
      We're excited to announce a new set of digital companion essays that add
      interpretive depth to the Norman B. Leventhal [Walk to the
      Sea](https://www.walktothesea.com/). A one-mile walk from Beacon Hill to
      Long Wharf, Walk to the Sea, invites you into the history of a city whose
      destiny and fortunes have long been shaped by the relationship between
      land and water. These digital essays were written by Northeastern
      University students for the course Practicum on the Place-Based Museum,
      taught at the Leventhal Center. From [Beacon
      Hill](https://www.walktothesea.com/locations/beacon-hill) and its impact
      on Bostonâ€™s rapid growth as a city to the [Long Wharf
      ](https://www.walktothesea.com/locations/long-wharf)and its role as a
      cultural and recreational asset, the stories highlighted in these essays
      prompt deeper thinking about this ever-evolving city.
