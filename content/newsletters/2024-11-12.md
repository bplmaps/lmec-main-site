      Exhibitions at the Leventhal Center are always evolving to offer new entry
      points into geographic themes for all of our visitors, no matter their
      age. Newly featured in the gallery as an accompaniment to the current
      exhibit *[Processing
      Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/)*
      are four child-centered activities that explore different aspects of
      computer cartography. With activities on map layers, categorizing pixels,
      matching key words, and children’s literature on mapmaking, you’ll find
      many different opportunities to try your hand at the elements of computer
      cartography. Be sure to check out the nooks on your next visit to the
      gallery!

  - content_block_header: 'Walk to the Sea: New Essays'
    content_block_text: >
      We're excited to announce a new set of digital companion essays that add
      interpretive depth to the Norman B. Leventhal [Walk to the
      Sea](https://www.walktothesea.com/). A one-mile walk from Beacon Hill to
      Long Wharf, Walk to the Sea, invites you into the history of a city whose
      destiny and fortunes have long been shaped by the relationship between
      land and water.


      These digital essays were written by Northeastern University students for
      the course *Practicum on the Place-Based Museum*, taught at the Leventhal
      Center. From [Beacon
      Hill](https://www.walktothesea.com/locations/beacon-hill) and its impact
      on Boston’s rapid growth as a city to the [Long Wharf
      ](https://www.walktothesea.com/locations/long-wharf)and its role as a
      cultural and recreational asset, the stories highlighted in these essays
      prompt deeper thinking about this ever-evolving city.

      Before landfilling, the town of Boston was originally constrained in the
      Shawmut Peninsula, which was connected to the mainland by just a single
      road. Located on the “Boston Neck”, this road would eventually be named
      Washington Street, which is what we call it today. Sometimes referred to
      as “South End Road,” what was the original name of this street prior to
      the American Revolution?


      * Eliot Street

      * Shawmut Avenue

      * Orange Street

      * Belchers Land Road
