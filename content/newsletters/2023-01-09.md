introductory_text: Our urban atlas collections—the maps that you'll find in our [Atlascope](https://atlascope.org)
  tool—are so rich in detail, so packed with information about the Boston of a century
  ago, that it's easy to get lost in them. Soon, we'll be seeing the atlases in a
  new light, enlivened with narrative and images in our new in-person exhibition,
  _Building Blocks,_ which opens this Friday. At the same time, we'll also release
  the latest version of Atlascope, featuring opportunities to tell stories, annotate
  map layers, and open up other research collections. Meanwhile, a broader sweep on
  geographical history will also arrive in our gallery with the launch of our permanent
  exhibition _Becoming Boston._ There's never been a better time to see how the Leventhal
  Center's historical collections, digital tools, discovery opportunities, and geographical
  research programs weave together.
