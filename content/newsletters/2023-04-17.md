    content_block_text: >-
      "There is a very natural integration between our personal curiosities and
      the presentation of Atlascope, with all the cartographic details of
      historic urban atlases aligned seamlessly to a modern digital map—that is,
      until they are not," writes [Patricio
      Pino](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/patricio-pino/) in [his
      latest
      article](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/atlascope-explained-looking-between-the-cracks/),
      which examines the process of creating Atlascope. Can you name all the
      steps that are necessary to go from physical atlas to digital web layer?
