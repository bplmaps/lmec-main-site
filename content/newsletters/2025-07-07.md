  - content_block_header: Summertime Teacher Professional Development
    content_block_text: >
      Educators! Join your fellow teachers from across the country for virtual
      teacher workshops with the Leventhal Center Education team this summer. We
      will be focused on the American Revolution as we gear up for the
      semiquincentennial. Each session will provide both primary sources and
      tools to use with K-12 students to encourage them to think critically
      about how *where* the Revolution happened impacted what happened.
