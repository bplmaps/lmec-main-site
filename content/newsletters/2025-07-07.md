  - content_block_header: Summertime Teacher Professional Development
    content_block_text: >
      Educators! Join your fellow teachers from across the country for virtual
      teacher workshops with the Leventhal Center Education team this summer. We
      will be focused on the American Revolution as we gear up for the
      semiquincentennial. Each session will provide both primary sources and
      tools to use with K-12 students to encourage them to think critically
      about how *where* the Revolution happened impacted what happened.

  - content_block_header: 'From the Vault: June Roundup'
    content_block_text: "This past June, we hosted two From the Vault events.\n\n***[Cartography in the Classroom](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-cartography-in-the-classroom/)*** used a display of maps, globes, games, atlases and related objects to explore the evolution of geographic education, examine the visual aids were used by teachers in the classroom, and marvel at unique student-produced geography projects from the late eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. In\_***That Doesn’t Look Quite Right…***, we explored how maps can portray physical features in a misleading manner because of choices made by mapmakers.\n\nCheck out the maps from each of the events in the roundup articles linked below.\n"
