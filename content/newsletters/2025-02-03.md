      series](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/map-chat/), **Dr. Katherine Anne
      Paul**, the Lead Curator of Asian Art at the Birmingham Museum of Art,
      explores Jain cosmographic maps to examine perspectives on both the cosmos
      and the physical world. As you read this article, consider the unique ways
      these Jain maps illustrate the ideals of a physical world that lays

    content_block_text: "From the wharves of Boston Harbor to the filled land underneath Back Bay, sensors are all over the place. They collect information about environmental factors, like air quality, water levels, and climate. But how exactly do these tiny pieces of digital infrastructure work, and how do the massive volumes of data that they collect actually get used?\n\nJoin us for an in-person discussion about sensors and environmental data, moderated by LMEC staff\_**Ian Spangler**\_and\_**Emily Bowe**\_(co-curators of the Leventhal Center’s current exhibition,\_*[Processing Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/)*). You’ll learn about the contemporary digital technologies that quietly monitor the world around us, including what kinds of data can and can’t be collected, how people decide where to install sensors, and how the data is processed and transformed into actionable policies.\n"

    content_block_text: "The Boston Public Library is proud to announce two new research fellowships to support the use of BPL’s Special Collections:\n\n* The\_**Telling Boston's Stories Fellowship**\_is a four-week fellowship intended to support research projects whose focus is on the people and communities of Boston that are commonly left out of the historical narrative.\n* The\_**Surfacing Overlooked Stories Fellowship**\_is an eight-to-ten-week fellowship intended to highlight often overlooked voices and narratives in our collections. The theme for the 2025-2026 Surfacing Overlooked Stories fellowship will be looking into Black life and culture from Boston’s founding in 1630 through Boston’s incorporation as a city in 1822.\n\nThe BPL is currently accepting applications for both fellowships and applications are due on\_**Monday, March 3, 2025**.\n"
