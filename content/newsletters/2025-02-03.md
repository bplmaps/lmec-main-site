      explores Jain cosmographic maps to examine perspectives on both the cosmos
      and the physical world. As you read this article, consider the unique ways

    content_block_text: "From the wharves of Boston Harbor to the filled land underneath Back Bay, sensors are all over the place. They collect information about environmental factors, like air quality, water levels, and climate. But how exactly do these tiny pieces of digital infrastructure work, and how do the massive volumes of data that they collect actually get used?\n\nJoin us for an in-person discussion about sensors and environmental data, moderated by LMEC staff\_**Ian Spangler**\_and\_**Emily Bowe**\_(co-curators of the Leventhal Center’s current exhibition,\_*[Processing Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/)*). You’ll learn about the contemporary digital technologies that quietly monitor the world around us, including what kinds of data can and can’t be collected, how people decide where to install sensors, and how the data is processed and transformed into actionable policies.\n"
