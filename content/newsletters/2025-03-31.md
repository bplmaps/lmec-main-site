      Our newest exhibition, *Terrains of Independence*, is almost here! Last
      week, we deinstalled\* [Processing
      Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/)\*,
      which saw over 28,000 visitors during its seven-month run. Our
      staff—alongside colleagues from the Boston Public Library, art hangers,
      and vinyl installers—have been working to transform our gallery. Join us
      for Opening Day on April 3 to see how maps can offer a unique entry point
      to reconsider the Revolutionary War through the lens of locality and
      place. *Terrains of Independenc*e will be on display through March 2026,
      covering the 250th anniversary of the most important Revolutionary moments
      in Boston and Massachusetts. We hope to see you there!
