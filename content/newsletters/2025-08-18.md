      Virtual: Urban Space, Water, and Health in Colonial Charleston · Sep 16, 6
      pm ET 
    content_block_text: "Join us this fall for a conversation in the [Brown Seminar on the Historical Geography of the American Revolutionary Era](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/richard-h.-brown-seminar/) with historian **Molly Nebiolo**. Professor Nebiolo\_will explore the colonial geography of Charleston with a focus on tidal creeks and other waterbodies—both those marked on maps of this period as well as those hidden in the cartographic record. These maps open up a new perspective on the history of health and environment in the eighteenth century colonial American city.\n\n*This program is part of the [American Revolutionary Geographies Online (ARGO)](https://www.argomaps.org/) project.*\n"

      In-Person: Street Imperialism: Cities at the Onset of Colonization ·
      August 22, 2 pm ET
    content_block_text: "A city plan is a window into a city’s culture and ways of life. Unfortunately, most historic urban maps that have made their way into modern collections were created by European and American cartographers and primarily depict cities designed or strongly influenced by European practices. This leaves many peoples, cities, and cultures cartographically underrepresented.\n\nThis\_*From the Vault*\_map collections showing will spotlight highlights in our collections that depict global, pre-industrial cities that were founded by non-European cultures. Selections are curated by our\_Visitor Services & Exhibition Assistant,\_**Artem Sereda**.\n"

      Virtual: Mapping Basics & the American Revolution (for Elementary
      Students) · Sep 17, 6:30 pm ET 
    content_block_text: "Maps are everywhere in textbooks about the American Revolution—troops on the move, shifting borders, colonies becoming states. But how can we help students really\_*read*\_these maps instead of skipping over them?\n\nIn this session, we’ll break down foundational map-reading skills and explore strategies to get students beyond “this is here, that is there.” We’ll also introduce the [American Revolutionary Geography Online (ARGO)](https://www.argomaps.org/) project and items from the Leventhal Center map collection to support your curriculum development. You’ll leave with classroom-ready ideas that center student inquiry and recognize whose stories maps include—and exclude.\n"
