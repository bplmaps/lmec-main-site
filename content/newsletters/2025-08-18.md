      We’re excited to introduce **Alex Jones** as our new Learning Resource
      Specialist at the Leventhal Center! Alex joined us this June and has an
      extensive history in library and museum work. We sat down with Alex to
      learn more about his interest in the American Revolution, his favorite
      digital tools, and his must-see item from *[Terrains of
      Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/)*.
