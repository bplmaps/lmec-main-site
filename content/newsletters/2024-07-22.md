  - content_block_header: Tribute and Territory in the Pequot Country
    content_block_text: >
      In May 1637, the General Court of Connecticut declared war against the
      Indigenous Pequot nation in an attempt to seize control of their
      territory. Maps can offer a window into the ideas of land ownership and
      control that shaped this brutal competition between the Indigenous and
      Colonist forces. In this digital essay by **Alice King**, supported by the
      the Leventhal Center’s [Small Grants for Early Career Digital
      Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/)
      program, learn about how colonial maps of the Pequot Country tell
      complicated stories about the political geography of seventeenth century
      New England.
