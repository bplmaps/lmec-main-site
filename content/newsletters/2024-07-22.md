  - content_block_header: Tribute and Territory in the Pequot Country
    content_block_text: "In May 1637, the General Court of Connecticut declared war against the Indigenous Pequot nation in an attempt to seize control of their territory. Maps can offer a window into the ideas of land ownership and control that shaped this brutal competition between the Indigenous and Colonist forces. The colonial maps from John Foster and John Seller offer a particular perspective on the world of seventeenth century northeastern colonial America, their use of the phrase “Pequot Country” concealing as much as it reveals. This digital essay by\_**Alice King** was supported by the the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/) program.\n"

      We’re excited to introduce **Sam Walker** to the LMEC community as our
      Visitor Service and Exhibition Assistant! Sam joined us this July as a
      Northeastern Co-op student and is currently a Pre-Law student studying
      History, Culture, and Law and minoring in Art History. We sat down with
