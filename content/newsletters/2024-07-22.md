  - content_block_header: Tribute and Territory in the Pequot Country
    content_block_text: "In May 1637, the General Court of Connecticut declared war against the Indigenous Pequot nation in an attempt to seize control of their territory. Maps can offer a window into the ideas of land ownership and control that shaped this brutal competition between the Indigenous and Colonist forces. The colonial maps from John Foster and John Seller offer a particular perspective on the world of seventeenth century northeastern colonial America, their use of the phrase “Pequot Country” concealing as much as it reveals. This digital essay by\_**Alice King** was supported by the the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/) program.\n"

    content_block_text: >
      We’re excited to introduce **Sam Walker** to the LMEC community as our
      Visitor Service and Exhibition Assistant! Sam joined us this July as a
      Northeastern Co-op student and is currently a Pre-Law student studying
      History, Culture, and Law and minoring in Art History. We sat down with
      Sam to learn more about her interests, upcoming work at the Center, and
      her favorite map in the collection.

  - content_block_header: What’s Going On In The Gallery? - Olympic City Rivalry Comes to the LMEC
    content_block_text: >
      Would Boston have made a good city to host the 2024 Olympics? This is a
      question you’ll see posed to visitors this month at the Leventhal Map &
      Education Center. Located towards the back of our gallery as an
      interactive element of our permanent Becoming Boston exhibit, "Looking
      Closely" prompts visitors to examine a historical map and ask them to
      respond to a corresponding question. 


      While typically showing maps of Boston, in this month leading up to the
      Olympic games in Paris, we thought to reignite the decade-old question of
      Boston as an Olympic host city. In 2015, Boston did actually put in a bid
      to host the 2024 games and we ask visitors if they think Boston would have
      been a good host. Visit the gallery through the end of the games, August
      11, to take part in the poll!

  - content_block_header: 'Civic Switchboard Recap '
    content_block_text: >
      This past June, the Leventhal Center partnered with our wonderful
      colleagues at Civic Switchboard to host an extended workshop on civic
      data. Assistant Curator of Digital and Participatory Cartography, **Ian
      Spangler**, participated in and taught at the workshop and wrote a short
      reflection on the event and has links to the Civic Switchboard materials.
