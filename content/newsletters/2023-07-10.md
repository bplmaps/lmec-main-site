    content_block_text: "We’re excited to announce that we’ve added\_five new atlas layers across three towns to Atlascope, extending coverage to Dover, Hull, and Lynn! Urban atlases are excellent resources for discovering concrete facts about historical geography (though they certainly are that—possibly no other resource provides the same level of accessibility and granularity). Beyond that, these atlases provide jumping-off points for telling new stories about the world around us. Check out this small selection of the kinds of stories you can find in the latest Atlascope layers.\n"

  - content_block_header: 'Want to see your town in Atlascope? '
    content_block_text: "We’re continuing work this summer and fall to add dozens more Massachusetts towns to Atlascope. However,\_we need help from you and your communities to make this happen.\_Transforming a single town atlas from printed pages into a modern, readable web-layer is\_[both costly and time-consuming](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/atlascope-explained-looking-between-the-cracks/), taking dozens of hours of skilled staff labor. If you’d like to see your town in Atlascope, and you know institutions, groups, or community members who’d like to help gather the funding to support this, please visit\_[this page](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/sponsor-an-atlas/)\_for more information, or reach out directly to our\_[Development Coordinator, Rachel Sharer](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/rachel-sharer/).\n"
