    content_block_text: "We’re excited to announce that we’ve added\_five new atlas layers across three towns to Atlascope, extending coverage to Dover, Hull, and Lynn! Urban atlases are excellent resources for discovering concrete facts about historical geography (though they certainly are that—possibly no other resource provides the same level of accessibility and granularity). Beyond that, these atlases provide jumping-off points for telling new stories about the world around us. Check out this small selection of the kinds of stories you can find in the latest Atlascope layers.\n"
