      Join the [Leventhal Center's 2025 Designer-in-Residence, **Meghan
      Kelly**](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/interview-with-meghan-kelly/),
      for a community map-creation project!


      In this workshop, we will collectively create map icons and develop an
      icon set for Boston. To begin, we will discuss the role of map icons in
      maps and will explore the limits of and opportunities for existing map
      icon libraries. We will then turn to a hands-on activity where we create
      iterative create icons for the city that better reflect our experiences of
      places. This icon set will be publicly available to mapmakers and
      educators for local mapping initiatives.


      This program is co-sponsored by [BPL Community
      History](https://www.bpl.org/community-history/).

  - content_block_header: 'American Prime Meridians: The Early Years'
    content_block_text: >
      If you’ve been able to see *[Terrains of
      Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/)*,
      you might have noticed a curious detail across the maps on display: there
      is no standard system for longitude. Because the prime meridian—or 0° line
      of longitude—can functionally be placed through any point on Earth, it was
      common practice in the late eighteenth century to use systems of longitude
      relative to important cities, such as London or Paris.


      In this article, historian **James E. Lewis, Jr.** explores the early
      efforts to create an American prime meridian that ran through Washington,
      D.C—and how these efforts considered a matter of national pride, as much
      as cartographic accuracy.

    content_block_text: >
      We’re excited to announce that the [Royal Danish
      Library](https://www.argomaps.org/partner-collections/commonwealth:cz30xk43k/)
      and [Filson Historical
      Society](https://www.argomaps.org/partner-collections/commonwealth:qn59z056g/)
      have joined ARGO as collections partners. From the Royal Danish Library’s
      holdings, you’ll find roughly 100 maps in ARGO that depict the Americas,
      the Atlantic region, and Greenland in the late eighteenth century.


      The maps included from the Filson Historical Society are a part of the
      First American West digital exhibition, an online collection of letters,
      financial records, sermons, books, maps, and objects relating to the Ohio
      River Valley in the mid-1700s through the early 1800s. Be sure to look
      through ARGO for what each collection has to offer.

In *[Changed/Forgotten: Places That No Longer Exist](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-changedforgotten-places-that-no-longer-exist/)*, maps showed historic counterparts of modern day cities and the ancient ruins of a fallen society,\_ demonstrating just how much has changed or been forgotten and how much still remains in contemporary landscapes. *[The Bonner Map & Beyond](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/highlights-from-the-vault-bonner-map-beyond/)* explored the many states of Captain John Bonner’s famous map of Boston, its evolution over a half-century, and its enduring cartographic influence into the twentieth century.\n\nCheck out the maps from each of the events in the roundup articles linked below.\n"
