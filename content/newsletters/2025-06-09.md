      Join the [Leventhal Center's 2025 Designer-in-Residence, **Meghan
      Kelly**](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/interview-with-meghan-kelly/),
      for a community map-creation project!


      In this workshop, we will collectively create map icons and develop an
      icon set for Boston. To begin, we will discuss the role of map icons in
      maps and will explore the limits of and opportunities for existing map
      icon libraries. We will then turn to a hands-on activity where we create
      iterative create icons for the city that better reflect our experiences of
      places. This icon set will be publicly available to mapmakers and
      educators for local mapping initiatives.


      This program is co-sponsored by [BPL Community
      History](https://www.bpl.org/community-history/).
