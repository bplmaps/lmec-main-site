  Burden: Causes and Consequences of Climate Change_](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:n2970j76b)
  (2022)'
introductory_text: Earlier this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
  (IPCC) released their sixth assessment report on the state of the global climate.
  In this report, IPCC drew attention to the fact that climate change is not only
  a problem of science, energy, and technology, but also a problem that demands "attention
  to equity and justice." That connection between environmentalism and social justice
  is exactly the topic that we investigate in our new exhibition [More or Less in
  Common](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/),
  which opened at the Central Library in Copley Square this past Friday. I hope you'll
  have a chance to [come and see it](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/visit/),
  or to [browse the digital exhibition](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/)
  if you're not in Boston. It's a show which brings all the strengths of the Map Center
  together, from historic collections that document past environments to original
  data visualizations challenging us to imagine a more just future.

    Here’s a riddle for you. What has no shape, takes no form, and greatly impacts our experiences of urban space?

    Is it sunlight? Noise? Greenhouse gas emissions? Yes, yes, yes: all of these ephemeral qualities make for excellent answers (and they also feature prominently in [_More or Less in Common_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/)). They shape how we move through and engage with cities, even though we don’t see, feel, or touch them in the same way we might touch the dirt in a park or the bricks on a building. In this article, Ian Spangler focus on one of these ephemeral qualities that has shaped environmental management in Boston: **smell**.

  content_block_text: Last week on Instagram, we ran a geo challenge showing aerial
    imagery of five environmental justice sites in Massachusetts, connecting to case
    studies from [_More or Less in Common_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/).
    How many of these five places can you recognize from the air?

  content_block_text: A map of the Amazon long thought to be lost has been found in
    the MacLean Collection Map Library. This manuscript map of the Amazon region was
    made in 1755 by Anselm Franz Eckart (1721–1809) after a map compiled by János
    Nepomuk Szluha (1723–1803) in 1753. In this Map Chat commissioned by Richard Pegg
    of the MacLean Collection, Mirela Altic describes this exciting new discovery
    in the cartographic history of the Americas in the eighteenth century.
