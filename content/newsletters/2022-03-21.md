  Burden: Causes and Consequences of Climate Change_](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:n2970j76b)
  (2022)'
introductory_text: Earlier this month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
  (IPCC) released their sixth assessment report on the state of the global climate.
  In this report, IPCC drew attention to the fact that climate change is not only
  a problem of science, energy, and technology, but also a problem that demands "attention
  to equity and justice." That connection between environmentalism and social justice
  is exactly the topic that we investigate in our new exhibition [_More or Less in
  Common_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/),
  which opened at the Central Library in Copley Square this past Friday. I hope you'll
  have a chance to [come and see it](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/visit/),
  or to [browse the digital exhibition](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/)
  if you're not in Boston. It's a show which brings all the strengths of the Leventhal Center
  together, from historic collections that document past environments to original
  data visualizations challenging us to imagine a more just future.

  content_block_text: Invisible features like sunlight and noise shape how we move
    through and engage with cities, even though we don’t see, feel, or touch them
    in the same way we might touch the dirt in a park or the bricks on a building.
    In this article, Ian Spangler focuses on one of these ephemeral qualities that
    has shaped environmental management in Boston—_odor_—by taking a close look at
    an 1878 map of the city's nuisance smells..

  content_block_text: Last week on Instagram, we ran a geo challenge showing aerial
    imagery of five environmental justice sites in Massachusetts, connecting to case
    studies from [_More or Less in Common_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/).
    How many of these five places can you recognize from the air?

- content_block_header: A rediscovered map of the Amazon
  content_block_text: A map of the Amazon long thought to be lost has been found in
    the MacLean Collection Map Library. This manuscript map of the Amazon region was
    made in 1755 by Anselm Franz Eckart after a map compiled by János Nepomuk Szluha
    in 1753. In this Map Chat commissioned by the MacLean Collection's Richard Pegg,
    the historian of cartography Mirela Altic describes this fascinating new find
    that helps us better understand European imperial mapping in South America.

subject_line: When you imagine a map of the "environment," does it have people in
  it?
