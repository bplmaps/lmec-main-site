  content_block_text: We've just opened two new programs to support researchers and
    designers working on geography and cartography. The [Small Grants for Early Career
    Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants)
    program provides funding and technical assistance for scholars in any humanities
    or social science discipline working towards a digital publication for the public.
    The [Designer-in-Residence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/designer-in-residence)
    Fellowship is our very first residential fellowship for cartographers and designers
    working on geographic themes.

- content_block_header: Exploring the geography of the Boston Public Schools exam
    invitation system
  content_block_text: As part of his work with the LMEC team this summer, high school
    senior [Kyler Hoogendoorn-Ecker](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/kyler-hoogendoorn-ecker/)
    researched the method by which students are assigned to public exam schools in
    Boston. He observes that attempts to make the admissions process more equitable
    have led to three changes in this admission system in as many years. How do maps
    help us make sense of which Boston students are most likely to attend the exam
    schools?
