  - content_block_header: 'Introducing: Allmaps Here'
    content_block_text: >
      A few weeks ago, we shared [an update about our NEH
      grant](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/neh-allmaps-statement-2025/)
      to support institutional infrastructure for libraries, museums, and other
      digitized map collections through the [Allmaps
      project](https://allmaps.org). The Allmaps team has continued their work
      and recently released an exciting new tool: *[Allmaps
      Here](https://here.allmaps.org/)*. 


      With *Allmaps Here*, you can see your current location on top of maps from
      many different collections that have already been georeferenced. If you
      don’t see a map for your area, it might be time for you to georeference a
      new one from [our collections](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/)!
      (Pro tip: our team is a big fan of using *Allmaps Here* if you are
      traveling by train!)

  - content_block_header: Boston Public Library Launches Restoration Planning Process
    content_block_text: >
      The Boston Public Library recently announced the launch of a
      comprehensive, five-year planning process for the renovation of the
      Central Library’s historic McKim building. The process, funded by a
      transformational $5.5 million gift made by an anonymous donor through the
      Boston Public Library Fund, will bring renovation plans to a design-ready
      phase. 


      At present, nearly 40 percent of the McKim Building is currently closed to
      the public, due to its accessibility challenges and disrepair. This
      generous gift with lay the foundation for a reimagined Central Library
      complex that will serve the needs of patrons from Boston and beyond.
