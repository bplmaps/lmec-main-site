  - content_block_header: 'Introducing: Allmaps Here'
    content_block_text: >
      A few weeks ago, we shared [an update about our NEH
      grant](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/neh-allmaps-statement-2025/)
      to support institutional infrastructure for libraries, museums, and other
      digitized map collections through the [Allmaps
      project](https://allmaps.org/#about-allmaps). The Allmaps team has
      continued their work and recently released an exciting new tool: [Allmaps
      Here](https://here.allmaps.org/). With Allmaps Here, you can see your
      current location on top of maps from many different collections that have
      already been georeferenced. If you don’t see a map for your area, it might
      be time for you to georeference a new one from [our
      collections](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/)! (Pro tip: our team is
      a big fan of using Allmaps Here if you are traveling by train!)

  - content_block_header: Boston Public Library Launches Restoration Planning Process
    content_block_text: >
      The Boston Public Library recently announced the launch of a
      comprehensive, five-year planning process for the renovation of the
      Central Library’s historic McKim building. The process, funded by a
      transformational $5.5 million gift made by an anonymous donor through the
      Boston Public Library Fund, will bring renovation plans to a design-ready
      phase, laying the foundation for a reimagined Central Library complex that
      will serve the needs of patrons from Boston and beyond.
