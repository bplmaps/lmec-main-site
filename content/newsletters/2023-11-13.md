      What was East Boston like in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries? What
      schools and churches were around? Were any industries based in East
      Boston? To celebrate the [tenth
      anniversary](/75ed01d232674b98a119331e120140b3?pvs=25) of the newest
      location of the East Boston Branch Library, LMEC staff member [Micaela
      Kahn](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/micaela-kahn/) created an
      Atlascope tour that explores the history of the branch and the
      neighborhood around it through time.

  - content_block_header: Many Chances to Remake the Transit Map
    content_block_text: "Ever wanted to reshape the map of the T? Well, there’s many chances to do so this winter. Starting with our transit-themed [Cartography Challenge](https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/cartography-challenge/transportation-dreams/), we’re looking for speculative or imaginary maps of transit in Boston with applications running through \_December 19, 2023. For the month of November, we’re also running a [fundraising auction](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/transit-map-auction/) where you can bid on “renaming” your favorite stations on the Red, Orange, Green, and Blue lines. Finally, as the holiday season approaches, the Boston Society for Architecture is hosting a transit-themed gingerbread cookie competition called [Transit: Boston on the Move](https://www.architects.org/exhibitions/2023-gingerbread-design-competition-exhibition). In our opinion, there’s no better (and tastier!) pairing than a day of [_Getting Around Town_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/) and some cookie baking. Be sure to register your team by November 17 in order to participate.\n"
