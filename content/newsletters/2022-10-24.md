- content_block_header: 'In-Person: Author Talk: Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò on Elite Capture
    · Nov 16, 6:00pm ET'
  content_block_text: 'Join the philosopher [Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò](http://www.olufemiotaiwo.com/)
    for a discussion of his new book _Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity
    Politics (And Everything Else)_. His work explores the process by which a radical
    concept can be stripped of its political substance and liberatory potential by
    becoming the victim of elite capture—deployed by political, social, and economic
    elites in the service of their own interests. For this discussion, Dr. Táíwò will
    be joined by [Samia Hesni](http://www.samiahesni.com/), Assistant Professor of
    Philosophy and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Boston University.'
