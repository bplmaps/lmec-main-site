  Richard Williams, *[A plan of Boston, and its environs: shewing the true
  situation of His Majesty's army, and also those of the
  rebels](https://www.argomaps.org/maps/commonwealth:3f462w352/)* (1776)

  Just over 250 years ago, in February 1775, the British Parliament set its
  attention on “the province of the [Massachuset's
  Bay](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015040119557?urlappend=%3Bseq=151%3Bownerid=1304246-157),”
  and reported to King George III that “a rebellion at this time actually exists
  within the said province.” Parliament didn’t focus on specific acts of
  rebellion or name political leaders. Their concern was directed at an entire
  place on the map\*:\* the province of Massachusetts. In our next exhibition at
  the Leventhal Center, *Terrains of Independence*, we take geography as the
  starting point for reconsidering the familiar story of the American
  Revolution. Why *was* it Massachusetts that became the center of Revolutionary
  action against British rule in 1775—why not the Carolinas, or Quebec, or
  Jamaica? And how did the terrain of Boston and its surrounding areas shape the
  strategy, the politics, and the ideas of the movement that lead to
  independence for the United States?


  To delve deeper into these questions, we hope you’ll join us for a visit
  *Terrains of Independence* soon. Co-curated by **Dr. Katy Lasdow**, the
  exhibition is not only visually rich but also takes a different approach to
  the Revolutionary anniversary that we think will change your perspective on
  this historical moment. *Terrains of Independence* opens **April 3** in our
  gallery at the Central Library, and, as always, admission is free.

      As a subscriber to our newsletter, we wanted to offer you a chance to get
      a first peek into the exhibition before it opens to the public. Here’s how
      we describe William Price’s 1769 [map of
      Boston](https://www.argomaps.org/maps/commonwealth:3f462v496/), which will
      be on display in the original. It will also serve as the basis for a new
      annotated map created by our teen curators from Boston Public Schools.


      *“Only a few North American cities were mapped on this scale and at this
      level of detail before the Revolution. The carefully labeled streets,
      wharves, and public buildings reveal a prosperous port city where
      different social classes lived near each other, with churches, meeting
      houses, and schools densely dotted throughout the urban core. Yet the very
      features that made Boston valuable to Britain—its deep harbor, network of
      wharves, and location in the New England region—would soon **help
      transform it into a center of resistance.**”*

  - content_block_header: Searching maps by scale in the ARGO portal
    content_block_text: "*Terrains of Independence*\_is organized around the different\_*scales*\_of geography that shaped people’s experiences during the Revolutionary era. The maps in the Leventhal Center’s collections for this period range in scale from hand-drawn plans of forts and battlements to vast depictions of the western hemisphere. In the show, five scales—Empire, Region, City, Landmark, and Nation—become a powerful framework for understanding how place matters in shaping historical events.\n\nIn the [ARGO (American Revolutionary Geographies Online)](https://www.argomaps.org/) portal homepage, you’ll find a search feature that allows you to explore digitized maps by geographic scale. You can focus on each region or scale down to the tiniest plans of forts and individual buildings. Can you imagine how different scales of map were originally used for different purposes?\n"
