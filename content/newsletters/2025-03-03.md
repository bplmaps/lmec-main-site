  Richard Williams, *[A plan of Boston, and its environs: shewing the true
  situation of His Majesty's army, and also those of the
  rebels](https://www.argomaps.org/maps/commonwealth:3f462w352/)* (1776)
introductory_text: >
  Just over 250 years ago, in February 1775, the British Parliament turned its
  attention to “the province of the [Massachuset's
  Bay](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015040119557?urlappend=%3Bseq=151%3Bownerid=1304246-157),”
  and reported to King George III that “a rebellion at this time actually exists
  within the said province.” Parliament didn’t focus on specific acts of
  rebellion or name political leaders. Their concern was directed at an entire
  place on the map: the province of Massachusetts. In our next exhibition at the
  Leventhal Center, *Terrains of Independence*, we take geography as the
  starting point for reconsidering the familiar story of the American
  Revolution. Why did Massachusetts become the center of Revolutionary action
  against British rule in 1775—why not the Carolinas, or Quebec, or Jamaica? And
  how did the terrain of Boston and its surrounding areas shape the strategy,
  the politics, and the ideas of the movement that lead to independence for the
  United States?


  To delve deeper into these questions, we hope you’ll visit *Terrains of
  Independence* soon. Co-curated by **Dr. Katy Lasdow**, the exhibition is not
  only visually rich but it also takes a different approach to the Revolutionary
  anniversary that we think will change your perspective on this historical
  moment. *Terrains of Independence* opens **April 3** in our gallery at the
  Central Library, and, as always, admission is free.

      As a subscriber to our newsletter, we wanted to offer you a chance to get
      a first peek into the exhibition before it opens to the public. Here’s how
      we describe William Price’s 1769 [map of
      Boston](https://www.argomaps.org/maps/commonwealth:3f462v496/), which will
      be on display. It will also serve as the basis for a new annotated map
      created by our teen curators from Boston Public Schools.


      *“Only a few North American cities were mapped on this scale and at this
      level of detail before the Revolution. The carefully labeled streets,
      wharves, and public buildings reveal a prosperous port city where
      different social classes lived near each other, with churches, meeting
      houses, and schools densely dotted throughout the urban core. Yet the very
      features that made Boston valuable to Britain—its deep harbor, network of
      wharves, and location in the New England region—would soon **help
      transform it into a center of resistance.**”*

    content_block_text: "*Terrains of Independence*\_is organized around the different\_*scales*\_of geography that shaped people’s experiences during the Revolutionary era. The maps in the Leventhal Center’s collections for this period range in scale from hand-drawn plans of forts and battlements to vast depictions of the western hemisphere. In the show, five scales—Empire, Region, City, Landmark, and Nation—become a powerful framework for understanding how place matters in shaping historical events.\n\nIn the [ARGO (American Revolutionary Geographies Online)](https://www.argomaps.org/) portal homepage, you’ll find a search feature that allows you to explore digitized maps by geographic scale. You can focus on each region or scale down to the tiniest plans of forts and individual buildings. Can you imagine how different scales of map were originally used for different purposes?\n"

      Spotlight: Brown Seminar on Geographies of Contact between Soldiers and
      Civilians
    content_block_text: >
      Listen to scholar **John McCurdy** discuss the human-scaled geographies of
      contact between soldiers and civilians—from urban squares to barracks and
      lodging houses—during the Revolutionary War. McCurdy’s work examines the
      intimate spaces where the everyday realities of life during an imperial
      conflict became personalized.


      This talk was hosted in the Richard H. Brown Seminar on the Historical
      Geography of the American Revolutionary Era and features maps that can be
      found in the [ARGO (American Revolutionary Geographies
      Online)](https://www.argomaps.org/) portal.
