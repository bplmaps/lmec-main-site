  Just over 250 years ago, in February 1775, the British Parliament set its
  attention on “the province of the [Massachuset's
  Bay](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015040119557?urlappend=%3Bseq=151%3Bownerid=1304246-157),”
  and reported to King George III that “a rebellion at this time actually exists
  within the said province.” Parliament didn’t focus on specific acts of
  rebellion or name political leaders. Their concern was directed at an entire
  place on the map\*:\* the province of Massachusetts. In our next exhibition at
  the Leventhal Center, *Terrains of Independence*, we take geography as the
  starting point for reconsidering the familiar story of the American
  Revolution. Why *was* it Massachusetts that became the center of Revolutionary
  action against British rule in 1775—why not the Carolinas, or Quebec, or
  Jamaica? And how did the terrain of Boston and its surrounding areas shape the
  strategy, the politics, and the ideas of the movement that lead to
  independence for the United States?


  To delve deeper into these questions, we hope you’ll join us for a visit
  *Terrains of Independence* soon. Co-curated by **Dr. Katy Lasdow**, the
  exhibition is not only visually rich but also takes a different approach to
  the Revolutionary anniversary that we think will change your perspective on
  this historical moment. *Terrains of Independence* opens **April 3** in our
  gallery at the Central Library, and, as always, admission is free.
