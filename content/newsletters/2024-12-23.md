      Osgood Carleton’s [1795 map of
      Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:f4755474m)
      is in many ways a utilitarian document. With little ornamentation, it
      depicts a city of commerce, labor, and growing independent political power
      in the new republic. In this way, the map reflects the kind of life, built
      upon practical knowledge and work, that Carleton lived. At the same time,
      some of its details and omissions gesture toward class, racial, and
      political divides that marked late eighteenth-century Boston.

      Virtual: The Map in the Machine: Charting the Spatial Architecture of
      Digital Capitalism  · January 14, 6:30 pm ET
    content_block_text: "In this talk, based on his recent book\_*[The Map in the Machine](https://www.ucpress.edu/books/the-map-in-the-machine/paper)*,\_**Luis F. Alvarez León**\_examines how digital technologies have changed how we shop, work, play, and communicate, charting these changes through MapQuest and Google Maps to the rise of IP geolocation, ridesharing, and a new Earth Observation satellite ecosystem. To understand digital capitalism, we need to grasp how advances in geospatial technologies underpin the construction, operation, and refinement of markets for digital goods and services.\n\n**Luis F. Alvarez León**\_is an Associate Professor of Geography at Dartmouth College whose work focuses on the political economy of geospatial data, media, and technologies.\_\n"
