      Osgood Carleton’s [1795 map of
      Boston](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:f4755474m)
      is in many ways a utilitarian document. With little ornamentation, it
      depicts a city of commerce, labor, and growing independent political power
      in the new republic. In this way, the map reflects the kind of life, built
      upon practical knowledge and work, that Carleton lived. At the same time,
      some of its details and omissions gesture toward class, racial, and
      political divides that marked late eighteenth-century Boston.


      Zoom in one of the Leventhal Center’s most astonishing new acquisitions
      with **John W. Mackey**, a Master Lecturer of Social Sciences in the
      College of General Studies at Boston University.
