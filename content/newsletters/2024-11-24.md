  This week is an opportunity for our team at the Leventhal Center to pause and
  reflect on just how much we’ve been doing lately. In the past week alone, we
  hosted a major national convening of digital humanities organizations to
  discuss the [Allmaps
  project](https://lmec-ws.observablehq.cloud/allmaps-news/2024-convening),
  welcomed educators from around the country [gathered in
  Boston](https://eomail4.com/web-version?p=9eaf7538-96c7-11ef-accd-6fad43156f5b\&pt=campaign\&t=1731613660\&s=c1b5999ac07dc9e9a6320ae66c4f5a62e170e052eafcf2b81619e56386f8c94e)
  for the National Council for the Social Studies conference, and collaborated
  with our colleagues on the [American Revolutionary Geographies
  Online](https://www.argomaps.org) project. All of that’s happening while we
  continue to welcome hundreds of visitors each week to our gallery [exhibition
  \*Processing
  Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/),\*
  support digital research projects from the community, bring new maps into the
  library collections, and more. We couldn’t do this work without you, and, as
  we enter the holiday season, perhaps you’ll consider [supporting our work with
  a gift](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/). Our work, and your support of
  it, lays the foundation for many future generations of learning,
  collaboration, and discovery.

  - content_block_header: Afro-Asian Diaspora and the Eaton Sisters
    content_block_text: "In a new digital essay by\_**Savita Maharaj** supported by the the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/) program, the story of a pair of boundary-crossing sisters comes alive on a map. Documenting the places and spaces where the Eaton sisters lived and wrote, Maharaj’s essay explores the sisters’ connection to the African and Asian spaces they inhabited, and how their work took inspiration from the geographies of their experiences as mixed-race Asian women in the in the late nineteenth century.\n"
