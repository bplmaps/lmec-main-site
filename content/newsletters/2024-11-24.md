  This week is an opportunity for our team at the Leventhal Center to pause and
  reflect on just how much we’ve been doing lately. In the past week alone, we
  hosted a major national convening of digital humanities organizations to
  discuss the [Allmaps
  project](https://lmec-ws.observablehq.cloud/allmaps-news/2024-convening),
  welcomed educators from around the country [gathered in
  Boston](https://eomail4.com/web-version?p=9eaf7538-96c7-11ef-accd-6fad43156f5b\&pt=campaign\&t=1731613660\&s=c1b5999ac07dc9e9a6320ae66c4f5a62e170e052eafcf2b81619e56386f8c94e)
  for the National Council for the Social Studies conference, and collaborated
  with our colleagues on the [American Revolutionary Geographies
  Online](https://www.argomaps.org) project. All of that’s happening while we
  continue to welcome hundreds of visitors each week to our gallery [exhibition
  \*Processing
  Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/),\*
  support digital research projects from the community, bring new maps into the
  library collections, and more. We couldn’t do this work without you, and, as
  we enter the holiday season, perhaps you’ll consider [supporting our work with
  a gift](https://www.leventhalmap.org/donate/). Our work, and your support of
  it, lays the foundation for many future generations of learning,
  collaboration, and discovery.

  - content_block_header: Afro-Asian Diaspora and the Eaton Sisters
    content_block_text: "In a new digital essay by\_**Savita Maharaj** supported by the the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](https://www.leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/) program, the story of a pair of boundary-crossing sisters comes alive on a map. Documenting the places and spaces where the Eaton sisters lived and wrote, Maharaj’s essay explores the sisters’ connection to the African and Asian spaces they inhabited, and how their work took inspiration from the geographies of their experiences as mixed-race Asian women in the in the late nineteenth century.\n"

      Join **Julia Williams**, Gallery & Communications Coordinator at the
      Leventhal Map & Education Center, together with BPL Research Services to
      discuss the use of historic maps for genealogical research. Julia has
      experience working with New England Historical Genealogical Society as a
      genealogist on [10 Million Names](https://10millionnames.org/), a project
      aimed at recovering the names of the estimated ten million men, women, and
      children of African descent who were enslaved in pre- and post-colonial
      America. She will also provide a demo of
      [Atlascope](https://www.atlascope.org/), which overlays historic maps on
      top of modern-day ones so you can easily compare past and present.

  - content_block_header: A Local Connection to Computer Graphics History
    content_block_text: >
      If you’ve had a chance to see our current exhibition [Processing
      Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/),
      you might have noticed the early [maps made using overprinted typewriter
      characters](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/catalogue/01-spatial-experiments/1.2/).
      In a recent article for the Harvard Graduate School of Design, **A. Krista
      Sykes** delves into the history of Harvard’s Laboratory for Computer
      Graphics and Spatial Analysis, which created the early software that made
      these typewritten maps. As Sykes writes, “…this multidisciplinary research
      group developed programs for automated mapping and spatial analysis that
      changed the ways we understand and create the world around us, from
      forecasting the weather to designing buildings.” The article builds on
      research using primary sources in the Loeb Library Special Collections at
      the Graduate School of Design.

  - content_block_header: 'Gallery Feature: November “From the Vault” Roundup'
    content_block_text: >
      In November, we hosted two* From The Vault* events:** Indigenous
      Geographies**, curated in partnership with the Supporting Indigenous
      Communities Fellow at the Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, and
      **Doing More with Maps**, a feature for the National Council for Social
      Studies Conference. These events asked our visitors to think deeper about
      each map’s purpose and we invite you to ask and answer these same
      questions in these roundup articles.
