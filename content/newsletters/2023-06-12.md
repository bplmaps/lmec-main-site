  - content_block_header: Mapping 250 Years of Poetry in Boston
    content_block_text: >
      "In Boston’s dense and contradictory history, stretching from the horrors
      of American slavery to the privileged complacency of east coast academia
      and suburbia, and including both the harsh realities of socio-economic
      inequality and the community-based activism and solidarity which it
      sparks, there is always something to be gained from a closer look at the
      personal lives and diverse experiences of the countless people involved,"
      writes Northeastern University co-op student [Patricio
      Pino](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/patricio-pino/) in his
      latest article on mapping poetry in Boston.

      Migration](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/north-to-boston-9780197614440?cc=us\&lang=en&)*.
      He gave  previews into the life stories of ten people who moved to Boston
      from the South as part of the Great Migration and spoke about the process
      to reconstruct such stories. In case you missed the talk, the recording is
      now available to view on our YouTube channel.
