      The City of Boston Planning Department is launching a new initiative to
      create a Planning Academy, an accessible resource for civic education that
      is community-centered and contextualizes planning and development in
      Boston. The Leventhal Center will serve as a partner in this work by
      providing resources about urban history and civic geography to support the
      Academy’s work. The Planning Department currently seeks RFPs for

      In person | From the Vault: As Little Land As Possible · March 21, 2:00 pm
      ET 
    content_block_text: >
      Though over 70% of the planet’s surface is covered in water, few stop to
      think about how we map this huge segment of the Earth (and how important
      it is we do so). From detailing the best maritime trade routes to
      documenting exploratory journeys across the sea, maps of our largest
      bodies of water can push the boundaries of our understanding of
      “conventional” map making.


      This free showing will be hosted **Friday, March 21** in the Leventhal Map
      & Education Center with a staff member available to answer questions. Drop
      in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM, no reservation required.

    content_block_text: "In February, we hosted two *From the Vault* events. **For the Love of Maps** was a nod to Valentine’s Day and saw staff highlighting their favorite maps alongside personal reflections. **Holding the Narrative: Understanding the Social and Real World Implications of Maps**, curated by our current Northeastern University co-op student **Zaila Alves**, took a close look at maps of the African continent and asked visitors to consider how what’s not included\_can be just as informative as what’s being represented.
