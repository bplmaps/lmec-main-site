    a 1912 tourist map showing principal summer vacation resorts reached by the Boston
    & Maine Railroad. With the recent Boston heat wave, our staff has had dreams of
    travel floating through our minds. This past Friday, our team headed to Portland,
    Maine to visit our friends at the [Osher Map Library](https://oshermaps.org/)
    for a day of staff learning and we got to see the railroad map in their current
    exhibition, [_Vacationland: Mapping History in Maine_](https://oshermaps.org/news).'

  content_block_text: "In case you missed it, our Boston transit trivia last Thursday

    of Steven Beaucher's out-of-print book [_Boston in Transit_](https://bostonintransit.com/products/boston-in-transit-mapping-the-history-of-public-transportation-in-the-hub).
    And in case you really are getting FOMO, here's the [trivia questions](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFF1zm11TE/jXnd6-jVgF2oSL1tqrEMDA/view?utm_content=DAFF1zm11TE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)
    our teams faced. \n\nLast week's event was our final trivia night of the summer,
    but we're looking at bringing back trivia for the fall and would love to get your
    ideas for topics related to Boston history & geography. Tell us what would get
    you out for a fun night of trivia with friends or family—or if you've come before,
    let us know what you thought of your experience."
