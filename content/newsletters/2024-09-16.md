    content_block_text: "Today, the maps that show up most often in our everyday lives—from walking directions on your phone to hourly weather maps—are made by computers. Even the simplest of these rely on vast databases of geographic information and complex systems of analysis and visualization. In our newest exhibition, [Processing Place: How Computers and Cartographers Redrew our World](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/), we look at how computers and cartography have fused together over the past century—and how they redrew our world in the process.\n\nFrom September 13, 2024 through February 2025, we invite you visit our gallery to learn how the computer became a cartographer. Processing Place\_is curated by Leventhal Center staff members Ian Spangler, Assistant Curator of Digital & Participatory Geography, and Emily Bowe, Assistant Director.\_Admission is free.\n"
