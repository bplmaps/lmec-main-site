  - content_block_header: Update on NEH Digital Humanities Advancement Grant
    content_block_text: >
      Allmaps is a set of tools that make it easier and more fun to work with
      digitized maps in library collections. It’s especially great for
      georeferencing, or overlaying old maps on modern geographies, which can
      turn historical maps into more useful research tools. In August 2023, we
      were awarded a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to
      help support further technical development of Allmaps, alongside work
      focused on the sustainability of the open-source tools. In April of this
      year, we received word—along with nearly 1500 other grantees—that the NEH
      intended to end our three-year grant after 18 months.

  - content_block_header: 'Summer 2025 Virtual Teacher Workshops '
    content_block_text: "Are you a teacher—or do you know one—who is looking to brush up on the American Revolution? Our virtual workshops this summer are a great way to gain a geographic perspective on this familiar story. If you’re using this time to recharge\_and\_get inspired for next year, we’d love to have you join us for one (or more!) of our upcoming virtual workshops. These workshops featured content from our current exhibition, *[Terrains of Independence](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/terrains-of-independence/)*, and are part of the [ARGO](https://www.argomaps.org/) (American Revolutionary Geographies Online) initiative.\n\nCan’t attend live?\_No problem. All registrants will receive access to the session recording and materials after the workshop.\n"
