  - content_block_header: Update on NEH Digital Humanities Advancement Grant
    content_block_text: >
      Allmaps is a set of tools that make it easier and more fun to work with
      digitized maps in library collections. It’s especially great for
      georeferencing, or overlaying old maps on modern geographies, which can
      turn historical maps into more useful research tools. In August 2023, we
      were awarded a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to
      help support further technical development of Allmaps, alongside work
      focused on the sustainability of the open-source tools. In April of this
      year, we received word—along with nearly 1500 other grantees—that the NEH
      intended to end our three-year grant after 18 months.
