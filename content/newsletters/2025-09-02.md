      In-Person: The Best State Around: Historic Promotional State Maps ·
      September 5, 2 pm ET
    content_block_text: "It’s not uncommon to be proud of the place you live, but these maps take local pride to another level!\n\nIn this\_*From The Vault* program, we’ll take a look at promotional state maps from the 1890s to 1930s. Some of these maps use comedy to poke fun at the rest of the country, while others celebrate the history and triumphs of a region to capture the attention of a potential visitor. Each state does things a little differently, and we invite visitors to pose the question:\_*“What truly is the best state around?\"*\n"
