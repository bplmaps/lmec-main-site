      In-Person: The Best State Around: Historic Promotional State Maps ·
      September 5, 2 pm ET
    content_block_text: "It’s not uncommon to be proud of the place you live, but these maps take local pride to another level!\n\nIn this\_*From The Vault* program, we’ll take a look at promotional state maps from the 1890s to 1930s. Some of these maps use comedy to poke fun at the rest of the country, while others celebrate the history and triumphs of a region to capture the attention of a potential visitor. Each state does things a little differently, and we invite visitors to pose the question:\_*“What truly is the best state around?\"*\n"

  - content_block_header: 'From the Vault Map Collections Showing: August Roundup'
    content_block_text: >
      This past August, we hosted two *From the Vault* events.


      **Cartography at Length: The Longest Maps in the Library** featured some
      of the longest and tallest maps in the LMEC collections. From rivers to
      railroads, from green parks to gold rushes, these maps documented how
      cartographers have fixated on long landscapes—including one 12-foot long
      map of the Boston Marathon, printed on a receipt! **Street Imperialism:
      Cities at the Onset of Colonization** cast a spotlight on maps of global,
      pre-industrial cities that were founded by non-European cultures. With
      maps of China, Japan, Peru, even pre-colonial Florida, visitors were
      invited to reflect critically on the ways in which indigenous urban forms
      were changed by Western colonization.


      Check out the maps from each of the events in the roundup articles linked
      below.

      Virtual Teacher Workshop: Mapping Basics & the American Revolution (for
      Elementary Students) · Sep 17, 6:30 pm ET 
    content_block_text: >
      Join teachers from across the country for this virtual workshop. We will
      use the map collections of King George III to break down foundational
      map-reading skills and explore strategies to get students beyond “this is
      here, that is there.” We’ll also share how to use the [American
      Revolutionary Geography Online (ARGO)](https://www.argomaps.org/) portal
      and items from the Leventhal Center collection to support your curriculum
      development. You’ll leave with classroom-ready ideas that center student
      inquiry and recognize whose stories maps include—and exclude.

    content_block_text: >
      Visit our Learning Center, located in the rear of our gallery space inside
      of the Boston Public Library’s Central Library in Copley Square, for one
      of the best study spaces in the city. Come by for a quiet work space
      surrounded by maps, atlases, and books about the world around you.


      As the only indoor study space with views of the BPL courtyard, the
      Leventhal Center is the perfect place to get some work done (and maybe
      take a study break with some of our geographic puzzles). The Learning
      Center is open to the public during our [open
      hours](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/hours-directions/)—we hope to
      see you soon!
