  - content_block_header: A New History of Urban Renewal
    content_block_text: "“Maps were not just an end of urban renewal planning, but a means to that end and the active tool through which residents—notably Black residents in a majority white city—could participate in governance and shape their neighborhood,” writes [Claire Dunning](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/D/C/au102128034.html), author of [Nonprofit Neighborhoods: An Urban History of Inequality and the American State](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo159872695.html), in this new essay reflecting on Freedom House and citizen participation in Boston’s urban renewal. This digital work is part of the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](http://leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/)\_program.\n"

  - content_block_header: Divergent Meanings of Place in Mapping Japan
    content_block_text: >
      When a French captain sailed past Japan in the late eighteenth century, a
      guess about toponyms set off a century of cartographic confusion. The [Map
      Chat](https://www.leventhalmap.org/tags/map-chat/) below, written by [Radu
      Leca](https://scholars.hkbu.edu.hk/en/persons/RADULECA), examines the
      tension between how Europeans interpreted the island that they saw from a
      distance and the entirely different understandings which existed within a
      Japanese cultural and geographical context.
