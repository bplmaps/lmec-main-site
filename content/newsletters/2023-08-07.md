  - content_block_header: A New History of Urban Renewal
    content_block_text: "“Maps were not just an end of urban renewal planning, but a means to that end and the active tool through which residents—notably Black residents in a majority white city—could participate in governance and shape their neighborhood,” writes [Claire Dunning](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/author/D/C/au102128034.html), author of [Nonprofit Neighborhoods: An Urban History of Inequality and the American State](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo159872695.html), in this new essay reflecting on Freedom House and citizen participation in Boston’s urban renewal. This digital work is part of the Leventhal Center’s\_[Small Grants for Early Career Digital Publications](http://leventhalmap.org/research/digital-publication-small-grants/)\_program.\n"
