      In September 2023, weâ€™ll open our newest exhibition, *Getting Around Town:
      Four Centuries of Mapping Boston in Transit*! This exhibition will feature
      an extraordinary collection of transit maps and invite questions about how
      people have moved around the city in the past, present, and future. Our
      guest curator is Steven Beaucher, the author of Boston In Transit and
      owner of WardMaps in Cambridge. In this article, we talk with Steven about
      how he became immersed in transit mapping, and what he thinks will be most
      intriguing about the upcoming exhibition.
