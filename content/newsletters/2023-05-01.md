  - content_block_header: New Boston Transit Exhibition Coming in September
    content_block_text: >
      In September 2023, we’ll open our newest exhibition, *Getting Around Town:
      Four Centuries of Mapping Boston in Transit*! This exhibition will feature
      an extraordinary collection of transit maps and invite questions about how
      people have moved around the city in the past, present, and future. Our
      guest curator is **Steven Beaucher**, the author of *[Boston In
      Transit](https://bostonintransit.com/products/boston-in-transit-mapping-the-history-of-public-transportation-in-the-hub)*
      and owner of WardMaps in Cambridge. In this article, we talk with Steven
      about how he became immersed in transit mapping, and what he thinks will
      be most intriguing about the upcoming exhibition.

      Virtual: Benjamin L. Carp on Urban Geographies of the American Revolution
      · May 30, 7:00pm ET
    content_block_text: >
      How did Boston’s waterfront geography become a flashpoint for rebellion?
      How did public gathering spaces in Philadelphia create the context for
      democratic ideas about mass politics? Can maps help us learn whether New
      York City was deliberately set on fire in 1776? Join us on May 30 at 7PM
      with scholar **Benjamin L. Carp** to learn about these and other insights
      from a historical geographic approach to the Revolutionary period.

  - content_block_header: Bidding Adieu to April
    content_block_text: >
      April was National Poetry Month! You may not immediately put maps and
      poems in the same category, but both are mediums rich with meaning. Many
      of the maps in our collection even have poems inscribed on them, in
      legends, around borders, and hidden away in overlooked corners. Check out
      these examples of poems on maps, and let us know which is your favorite.
