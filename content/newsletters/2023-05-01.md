  - content_block_header: New Boston Transit Exhibition Coming in September
    content_block_text: >-
      In September 2023, we’ll open our newest exhibition, *Getting Around Town:
      Four Centuries of Mapping Boston in Transit*! This exhibition will feature
      an extraordinary collection of transit maps and invite questions about how
      people have moved around the city in the past, present, and future. Our
      guest curator is Steven Beaucher, the author of Boston In Transit and
      owner of WardMaps in Cambridge. In this article, we talk with Steven about
      how he became immersed in transit mapping, and what he thinks will be most
      intriguing about the upcoming exhibition.

      Virtual: Benjamin L. Carp on Urban Geographies of the American Revolution
      · May 30, 7:00pm ET
    content_block_text: >-
      How did Boston’s waterfront geography become a flashpoint for rebellion?
      How did public gathering spaces in Philadelphia create the context for
      democratic ideas about mass politics? Can maps help us learn whether New
      York City was deliberately set on fire in 1776? Join us on Tuesday, May 30
      at 7PM with scholar Benjamin L. Carp to learn about these and other
      insights from a historical geographic approach to the Revolutionary
      period.
