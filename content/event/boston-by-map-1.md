### Join the Leventhal Map and Education Center for a virtual session on historical geography! Bring your lunch, map questions, and enthusiasm.

Come virtually visit with volunteer Dennis McCarthy and Public Engagement & Interpretation Coordinator Rachel Mead as we take a trip into Boston historical geography. Then we'll widen our scope to answer your questions and figure out how to assist you in your own historical geography projects!

Learn about the Map Center's collections, tools, and more.

This session will be streamed on LMEC's Facebook and YouTube channels. Registrants will be emailed direct links to these streams.

Want to have input on what we talk about? Or have us discuss your project? Fill out this very short survey:
