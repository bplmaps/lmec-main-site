### K-12 Professional Development Workshop

###### July 11-13, 2022 9:00AM - 3:00 PM + 4.5 asynchronous hours

Who benefits when the natural world is flourishing and healthy? By contrast, who is harmed by a dangerous and degraded environment? This **three-day workshop for educators in grades 3-12**, hosted in Boston and Lowell, will focus on past and present ideas of environmental justice, looking closely at eastern Massachusetts and the reality of its post-industrial landscape. Through local case studies that incorporate **maps, data, documents, and physical landscapes**, participants will learn about activists' work and develop their own lessons/activities to use in the classroom. This workshop will feature ideas and models for **student-led civics projects** connected to environmental justice.

* **Locations**: Leventhal Map & Education Center, Boston Public Library (July 11 and 13) & Tsongas Industrial History Center, Lowell, MA (July 12)
* **Audience**: Teachers of grades 3-12
* **PDPs/Graduate Credi**t: 22.5 PDPs or 1 graduate credit optional

**Co-presented by the Leventhal Map and Education Center and Tsongas Industrial History Center**
