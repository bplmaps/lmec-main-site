###### K-12 Professional Development Workshop 

Co-presented by the Leventhal Map and Education Center and 

Who benefits when the natural world is flourishing and healthy? By contrast, who is harmed by a dangerous and degraded environment? This **three-day workshop for educators in grades 3-12**, hosted in Boston and Lowell, will focus on past and present ideas of environmental justice, looking closely at eastern Massachusetts and the reality of its post-industrial landscape. Through local case studies that incorporate **maps, data, documents, and physical landscapes**, participants will learn about activists' work and develop their own lessons/activities to use in the classroom. This workshop will feature ideas and models for **student-led civics projects** connected to environmental justice.
