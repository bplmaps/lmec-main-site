### About this event

{{< figure src="https://iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org/iiif/2/commonwealth:xw42qq85p/full/,1200/0/default.jpg" caption="A [ca. 1970s plan of Boylston Street](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:9z905j23n)" >}}

The Boston Public Library sits on Boylston Street, one of the most important street corridors in the Back Bay neighborhood. In this _From the Vault_ program, we will combine historic maps, photographs, and other documents to explore how Boylston Street has changed over time—and to think about how it might change in the future. This drop-in event puts the City’s [latest street redesign](https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/boylston-street-bike-lanes-back-bay)—a new parking-protected bike lane between Massachusetts Avenue and Arlington Street and bus lane between Ring Road and Arlington Street—into historical perspective. Like the current gallery exhibition, [_Getting Around Town_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/), this program will use historical materials to prompt questions about how to build a more inclusive and equitable transportation system for the future.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.
