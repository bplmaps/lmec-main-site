Curious about computer cartography? Join us for an afternoon of close map looking, examining maps and other collections objects objects that give a window into the early period of computer cartography, but that didn’t quite make the cut for our current gallery exhibition.

For this edition of From The Vault, come see early GIS maps of Massachusetts, alongside other cartographic objects that help give insight into the early relationships of computers and cartographers. This drop-in showing will be hosted Friday, September 27 from 2-4 pm in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions. This collections showing event was specially curated by our Assistant Director, **Emily Bowe**.

No advance registration is required

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
