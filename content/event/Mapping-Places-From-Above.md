### About this event

The Boston Public Library holds a remarkable collection of approximately 500 bird’s-eye view maps from the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. How were these maps produced? How accurate are they? What sorts of historical information can we learn from them?

Join the Leventhal Map & Education Center with the [Jamaica Plain Historical Society](https://www.jphs.org/) at the [Jamaica Plain Branch Library](https://www.bpl.org/locations/jamaica-plain/) on Thursday, October 5 at 6:00 pm ET for a deep dive on bird’s-eye view maps of Boston, mapmaking techniques and more.
