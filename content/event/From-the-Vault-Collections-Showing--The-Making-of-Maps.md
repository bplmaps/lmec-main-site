### About this event

“Cartography,” the practice of creating and studying maps, has evolved greatly over the last several thousand years alongside humans. As our understanding of the world around us has shifted, so too have the ways in which we are able to represent the world we've come to know. Throughout this process, countless different techniques have been utilized across many different cultures and time periods to be able to most accurately represent what we see around us. What did these processes look like, and which have ultimately proven to stand the test of time? Come decide for yourself during “The Making of Maps” From the Vault!

This drop-in showing will be hosted Friday, August 16 from 2-4 pm in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions. This collections showing event was specially curated by our Visitor Services & Exhibition Assistant, **Samantha Walker**.

No advance registration is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
