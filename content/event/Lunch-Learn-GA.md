### About this event

Let’s get reading! We’re starting a new, thematic book club centered around geography, history, anthropology, and more. Unlike conventional book clubs where everyone reads the same book, this book club invites folks to select any book that falls within the designated theme for the month.

This month, we’re reading books on mathematical geography and cartography. Books covering these topics fall under Subclass GA of the Library of Congress Classification system. Check out our list of recommendations or find a title on your own!
