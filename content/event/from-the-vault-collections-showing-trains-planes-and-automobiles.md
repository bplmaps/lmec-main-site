##### _From The Vault_

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, _From The Vault_, attempts to remedy that limitation. _From The Vault_ is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions **do not** include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
