Did it inspire you to learn more about Boston's history of building on landfill? If you're not sure where to start on your educational journey, join us at lunch on Tuesday 6/22 to discuss shoreline change in the city of Boston and take a closer look at the maps from the article! Zoom details will be emailed to registrants.
