Please join us for a special reception as we open the Leventhal Map & Education Center's newest exhibition: *Terrains of Independence*.

The opening event will feature gallery tours, a discussion with curators ***Katy Lasdow*** and ***Garrett Dash Nelson***, and light refreshments.

* Beginning at 5 pm, we’ll have light snacks in the Commonwealth Salon of the Central Library (on the 1st floor across from the Leventhal Center gallery) and we look forward to mingling with you.
* Starting at 6 pm, we’ll begin short spoken remarks from LMEC President & Head Curator Garrett Dash Nelson and co-curator Katy Lasdow.
* After spoken remarks, we’ll open the gallery for everyone to explore in groups, led by LMEC staff.
