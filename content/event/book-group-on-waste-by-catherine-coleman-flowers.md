### About this event

Join us for **three in-person book group sessions** on Catherine Coleman Flowers’s _Waste_, exploring "the largely invisible problem of inadequate waste and water sanitation infrastructure in rural communities in the United States.” In her book, Coleman Flowers—environmental health advocate, 2020 MacArthur Fellow, and rural development manager for Bryan Stevenson’s Equal Justice Initiative—unpacks the effects of structural poverty and what the struggle to undo it requires.

In conjunction with the Map Center’s current exhibition [_More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/), we will look at maps as we read, looking at the ways cartographers create visual representations of the unequal burdens of environmental dangers in our communities.

### Logistics

Copies of the book will be available at the first meeting for checkout with a Boston Public Library card. If you prefer audio or e-books, those are also available through the library and you can reserve those yourself through the library’s website. **You do not need to read prior to our first meeting**, but you may choose to do so.

Meetings will be held **in-person** at the Leventhal Map Center at the Boston Public Library on **April 21**, **April 28**, and **May 5** from 6:00PM-7:30PM. **Please only register if you are able to attend all three sessions.** We're looking forward to seeing you!
