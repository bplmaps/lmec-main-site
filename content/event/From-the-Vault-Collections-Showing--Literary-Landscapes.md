### About this event

Join the Leventhal Map & Education Center in exploring the worlds of some of the most iconic landscapes of storytelling! From Sherlock Holmes to Winnie the Pooh, we’ll examine the ways literature uses maps to strengthen the impact of storytelling.

A staff member from LMEC will be available to give a brief background to the maps and answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

#### From The Vault

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, From The Vault, attempts to remedy that limitation. From The Vault is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
