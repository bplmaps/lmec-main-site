### About this event

Join scholar Benjamin L. Carp on a tour through the urban spaces of the American Revolution. How did Bostonâ€™s waterfront geography become a flashpoint for rebellion? How did public gathering spaces in Philadelphia create the context for democratic ideas about mass politics? Learn about these and other insights from a historical geographic approach to the Revolutionary period in a visually rich, interactive scholarly discussion.

Benjamin L. Carp is the Daniel M. Lyons Professor of American History at Brooklyn College. He also teaches at the CUNY Graduate Center. He focuses particularly on urban politics, society, and culture in eighteenth-century America. In addition to his new book, _The Great New York Fire of 1776: A Lost Story of the American Revolution_, he has also written _Defiance of the Patriots: The Boston Tea Party and the Making of America_ (which won the triennial Society of the Cincinnati Cox Book Prize in 2013) and _Rebels Rising: Cities and the American Revolution_.
