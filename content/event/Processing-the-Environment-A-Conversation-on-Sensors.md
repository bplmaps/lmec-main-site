### About the event

From the wharves of Boston Harbor to the made land underneath Back Bay, sensors are all over the place. They collect information about environmental factors like air quality, water levels, and climate—but how exactly do these tiny pieces of digital infrastructure work, and how do the massive volumes of data that they collect actually get used?

On February 5th at 6:00PM at the Boston Public Library Central Branch in the Commonwealth Salon, join us for an in-person discussion about sensors and environmental data, moderated by LMEC staff **Ian Spangler** and **Emily Bowe** (curators of the Center’s current exhibition, *[Processing Place](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/processing-place/)*). You’ll learn about the contemporary digital technologies that quietly monitor the world around us, including the kinds of data that can and can’t be collected, how people decide where to install sensors, and how the data is processed and transformed into actionable policies.

**Christian Simonelli** has played a pivotal role at the Boston Groundwater Trust since his appointment as Executive Director in October 2014. His journey began back in 1999 when he joined as a part-time Field Engineer and later transitioned into a full-time role as the Trust's Technical & Recharge Coordinator from 1999 to 2014. Throughout his tenure, Christian diligently oversaw the installation and monitoring of groundwater levels across the Trust's extensive network of 800 plus wells. Notably, under his leadership, the Trust's website and data collection methods underwent a comprehensive transformation. In addition, he works closely with property owners citywide to safeguard groundwater levels from adverse impacts. Christian’s steadfast advocacy for groundwater recharge in areas with wood pile supported structures further showcased his unwavering commitment to the cause. With a degree in Environmental Engineering from the Wentworth Institute of Technology, Christian Simonelli continues to spearhead initiatives aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of Boston's groundwater landscape.
