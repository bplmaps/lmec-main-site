As Black History Month begins, From The Vault will examine the ways maps can support and inform the story of Black and African American history in the United States. These maps highlight the power cartography can have in shaping the lived experience of people in the United States and around the world.

A staff member from LMEC will be available to give a brief background to the maps and answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.
