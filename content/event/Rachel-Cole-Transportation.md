### About this event

What are transportation collections? What can we learn from them? What do they tell us about policy choices and transit investment? Join us on Wednesday, November 15 at 12:00 pm EST with **Rachel Cole** of [Northwestern University’s Transportation Library](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/libraries-collections/transportation/) for a virtual talk on archiving the past and present of transportation.

This talk will stream live to our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bplmaps) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LeventhalMapEducationCenter). Please register on Eventbrite below.

***Presented as part of our ongoing exhibition, [Getting Around Town: Four Centuries of Mapping Boston in Transit](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/).***
