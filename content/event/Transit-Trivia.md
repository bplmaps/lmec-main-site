### About this event

Transit trivia is back! Join us on Wednesday, November 1 at 6:00 pm ET in the Newsfeed Cafe to test your knowledge on the history of Boston’s trains, planes, and automobiles.

Trivia rounds will feature a geographic scavenger hunt using [Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/), knowledge about the city’s rails, routes, streets, stations, and more!

Registration is encouraged but not required. You may participate individually or as a member of a team. This event will be held in person in the Newsfeed Café at the [Central Library](https://www.bpl.org/locations/3/) in Copley Square. Prizes of maps will be awarded to winning teams!

Presented as part of our ongoing exhibition, Getting Around Town: Mapping Four Centuries of Boston in Transit.
