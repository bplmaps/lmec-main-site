### Join us for the kick off of the Osher Map Library's Monday Map Lunch Series

####  About this event

Please join us for the kick off of the Monday Map Lunch Series on September 13, 2021, at 12:00 PM. In conjunction with the opening of the physical exhibit "Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception" at the Leventhal Map and Education Center in the Boston Public Library, President and Head Curator Garrett Dash Nelson will present Don’t Believe Me On This: Engaging With Truth and Skepticism Through Maps & Data.

This event will be presented on Zoom and tickets are limited to the first 95 registrants. This event is free and open to the public.

Going forward the Monday Map Lunch Series will take place from 12:00 PM - 1:15 PM on the last Monday of the month, and will run through June, 2022. Each month scholars and practitioners from near and far will share their current endeavors in an informal (Zoom) environment with plenty of time for a robust Q&A session.
