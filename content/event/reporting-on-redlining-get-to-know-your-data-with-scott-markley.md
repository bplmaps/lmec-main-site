#### **Join us for a workshop on geospatial data and redlining maps with Scott Markley**

Join Scott Markley, a PhD Candidate in the Department of Geography at the University of Georgia, and LMEC Assistant Curator Ian Spangler for a workshop exploring the **spatial histories of redlining**. This workshop is a part of the **Get to Know Your Data** series, where we talk with and learn from the people and institutions that create, store, and share geospatial data. Participants will come away from the workshop with 1) a richer knowledge of the politics of data creation surrounding redlining maps, and 2) a basic understanding of how to explore and compare data in a geographic information system (GIS).

We’ll begin with a discussion of redlining and the **Homeowner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC)**. Then, Scott will provide a demo of a [spatial dataset](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkyajewyh) about redlining that he created. Participants are invited, though not required, to follow along with his demo on their own computers. In the spirit of the LMEC’s upcoming exhibition, [More or Less in Common](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/environmental-justice-exhibition-preview/), the workshop concludes with an activity that evaluates historically redlined areas in the context of environmental justice.

This workshop is free and open to the public. It is capped at 30 registrants. No prior experience with geographic information systems is required. Participants who wish to follow along with the workshop and explore the data on their own computers are encouraged to [download QGIS before the workshop](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/get-started-qgis/).
