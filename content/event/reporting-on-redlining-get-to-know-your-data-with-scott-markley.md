### About this event

Join [Scott Markley](https://snmarkley1.github.io/), a PhD Candidate in the Department of Geography at the University of Georgia, and LMEC Assistant Curator [Ian Spangler](https://itspangler.com/) for a workshop exploring the **spatial histories of redlining**.

This workshop is a part of the **Get to Know Your Data series**, where we talk with and learn from the people and institutions that create, store, and share geospatial data. Participants will come away from the workshop with 1) a richer knowledge of the politics of data creation surrounding redlining maps, and 2) a basic understanding of how to explore and compare data in a geographic information system (GIS).

We will begin with a discussion of redlining and the Homeowner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC). Then, Scott will provide a demo of a [spatial dataset](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkyajewyh) about redlining that he created. Participants are invited, though not required, to follow along with his demo on their own computers. In the spirit of the LMEC’s upcoming exhibition, [More or Less in Common](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/environmental-justice-exhibition-preview/), the workshop concludes with an activity that evaluates historically redlined areas in the context of environmental justice.

**This workshop assumes a basic knowledge of QGIS**. To participate in this free and open workshop, we ask that you have either 1) taken a GIS course through the LMEC previously or 2) are otherwise familiar with GIS. It is capped at 30 registrants, and participants should [download QGIS before the workshop](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/get-started-qgis/).
