### Learn about how the urban military spaces of colonial cities shaped the course of the Revolutionary War

Join scholar John McCurdy as we learn about the geographies of contact between soldiers and civilians—from urban squares to barracks and lodging houses—during the Revolutionary War. McCurdy’s work examines the small-scale spaces where the everyday realities of life during an imperial conflict became personalized.
