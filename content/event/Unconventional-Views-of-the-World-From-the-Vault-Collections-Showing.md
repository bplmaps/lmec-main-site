> **So… what if we told you the world map you’re used to seeing isn’t actually an accurate depiction of the world we inhabit?**

The Mercator Map Projection, introduced in 1569 by Gerardus Mercator, has long been considered the default world map by Western powers. But prior to the map's introduction, depictions of the world were much more varied across cultures. Why aren’t maps oriented with South at the top? Why is a map of the whole globe depicted as an single oval and not 3? Why not 4? And what does it mean to have the “most accurate” map of the world?

The conventions of our modern time may have us assert that we have the most accurate of data. But can older maps help us refresh our view to see things a little differently? We’ll take a closer look at maps from the Leventhal Center’s collection as we answer these questions during this *From the Vault* map collection showing!

This free showing will be hosted Friday, September 19 in the Leventhal Map & Education Center with a staff member available to answer questions. Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map & Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
