### About this event

Join author Daniel Dain and photographer Peter Vanderwarker as they talk about their new book, ***A History of Boston***. They will act as your tour guide through the history of the City and discuss what lessons can be learned for the challenges of a modern city today.

Boston is today one of the world’s greatest cities, first in higher education, hospitals, life science companies, and sports teams. It was the home of the Great Puritan Migration, the American Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the first civil rights movement, the abolition movement, and the women’s rights movement. But the city that gave us the first use of ether as anesthesia, the telephone, technicolor film, and the mutual fund―the city where Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott founded their world-changing partnership―was also the hub of the anti-immigration movement, the divisive busing era, and decades of self-inflicted decay.

Boston has the most important history of any American city. Yet its history has never been given a comprehensive treatment until now. Tour with Dan Dain from the arrival of First Peoples up to the election of Boston’s first woman and person of color as mayor. Dain’s masterful work explores the policies and practices that took Boston from its highest heights to its lowest lows and back again, and examines the central role that density, diversity, and good urban design play in the success of cities like Boston.
