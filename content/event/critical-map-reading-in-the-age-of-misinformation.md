#### **Join us for a public workshop on media literacy in the historic and contemporary cartographic landscape.**

Join LMEC Assistant Curator [Ian Spangler](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/ian-spangler/) and BPL Media & Journalism Research Specialist Erica Husting for a public workshop on media literacy in the historic and contemporary cartographic landscape. Weâ€™ll uncover inaccuracies, dive into issues of viral misinformation, and review methods of map interpretation as we head into the final week of our [Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception](https://www.leventhalmap.org/exhibitions/digital-exhibitions) exhibition.

This workshop is the latest in our **Thinking Spatially** series. We invite questions and comments from our live audience.
