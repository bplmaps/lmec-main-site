Fire insurance maps might not sound particularly interesting or relevant to students. But these maps contain heaps of information about cities and towns across the country. This session will demonstrate that these maps — and the Leventhal Center’s powerful Atlascope tool — can support robust conversations with your students about change and continuity in technology, commerce, culture, and community within urban environments.

In this virtual workshop, learn how to mine these maps and Atlascope to support your teaching.
