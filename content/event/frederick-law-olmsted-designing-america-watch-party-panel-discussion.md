### About this event

In the weeks leading up to Olmsted’s 201st birthday, stream the film Frederick Law Olmsted: Designing America for free. The film, which debuted nearly a decade ago in 2014, explores Frederick Law Olmsted as the creator of landscape architecture and his vision of parks as fine art and a necessity of urban life. The film also notes that Olmsted’s efforts to preserve nature created an “environmental ethic” decades before the environmental movement.

After watching the movie, join us on April 27 at 3 pm ET via Zoom for a lively discussion about the film and its contents. Our panel will include Justin Martin, Garrett Nelson, and Sara Cedar Miller — all of whom you’ll recognize from the movie! Prospect Park Alliance President Morgan Monaco will moderate the discussion.

##### Meet the panelists

Martin is a graduate of Rice University in Houston, Texas, and he lives in Forest Hills Gardens, a landmark New York City neighborhood designed by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.
