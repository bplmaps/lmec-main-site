### About this event

###### What do “housing and home” mean to you?

Whether they’re are viewed as economic commodities, cultural signifiers, or basic rights will differ drastically depending on whom you ask. When depicted in maps, these different perspectives can alter our perception of what housing and home mean. In this From The Vault, we’ll explore these different perspectives and ask questions about why our understanding of home can look so different for so many people. This showing is specially curated by our Assistant Curator of Digital & Participatory Geography, Ian Spangler!

This drop-in showing will be hosted Friday, June 21 from 2-4 pm in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions.

No advance registration is required.

#### From The Vault

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, From The Vault, attempts to remedy that limitation. From The Vault is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
