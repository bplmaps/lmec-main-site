### About this event

What would it look like if efforts to address climate change took seriously the relationship of the climate crisis to historic patterns of accumulated injustices? What kinds of political and economic conditions could offer the possibility for building a more just social order? And how do local movements for environmental and social justice situate themselves in the larger global geographies of climate change?

**Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò**, the author of [_Reconsidering Reparations_](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/reconsidering-reparations-9780197508893?cc=us&lang=en&#), will lead a roundtable discussion on how environmentalism should engage with local and global social justice efforts together with Boston-area organizers, activists, and policymakers.
