Join the Children’s Library and the Leventhal Map & Education Center to learn how maps can help shape imaginary worlds. Explore examples from a few fantasy and science fiction books before creating your own worldbuilding map. You’ll need something to draw with and something to draw on and any other materials you have laying around to add or build with. Be ready to learn some map lingo and exercise your creative muscles. If you send the Map Center pictures of finished maps, we’ll share them online! For children in grades 3-6.

To register, email Librarian Maggie at mlevine@bpl.org with the name and age of the child participating.
