Based on **Ethan Carr’s** award-winning book, *Boston’s Franklin Park* describes the landscape Frederick Law Olmsted designed in 1885 as the centerpiece of a unique municipal park system known as the Emerald Necklace.

Weaving together interviews with the author, park advocates, and park users, the film traces its decline, caused by patterns of institutionalized racism on the part of the city of Boston, and the heroic efforts of local residents to save it from ruin. Now, as the city is poised to spend millions of dollars to improve the park, the film presents an important crossroads: “As we look forward to the city—finally, after decades of official neglect—investing major amounts of money in Franklin Park, the question is how should the city move forward?."

***Moderator:*** Gary R. Hilderbrand, Chair, Department of Landscape Architecture, Harvard University

***Panelists:*** Ethan Carr, Professor, University of Massachusetts Amherst; Karen Mauney-Brodek, President, Emerald Parks Conservancy; and Louis Elisa, Franklin Park community advocate
