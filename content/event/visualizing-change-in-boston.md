### **_Small Bites: Visualizing Change in Boston_**

For the 2021-22 school year the Map Center is offering a series of FREE “small bites” professional development sessions foregrounding teaching about Boston through a social justice lens, though the sessions are easily adaptable to other municipalities. These 6 sessions will run after school and will be a mix of in-person and Zoom sessions designed to send you off with great map-based lessons and resources to immediately implement in your classroom. All K-12 teachers are welcome. Sign up for one or all of them!

In this session, come try out our lesson developed for Boston high school students exploring four case studies using maps and other resources that show community action and change in Boston, from the Southwest Corridor to the Dudley Triangle. You can take away this ready-to-go lesson along with other versions of _Visualizing Boston_ and use it right away in your classroom.
