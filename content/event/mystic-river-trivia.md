Join the us with the [Mystic River Watershed Association](https://mysticriver.org/) (MyRWA) for a conversation on the historic Mystic River and MyRWA's past and present efforts to protect it. This talk will map development along the Mystic River, touching on the need for public access and climate resilience planning.

The Mystic River Watershed Association (MyRWA) was founded in 1972 with a mission to protect and restore the Mystic River, its tributaries and watershed lands for the benefit of present and future generations and to celebrate the value, importance and great beauty of these natural resources. Our vision is a vibrant, healthy and resilient Mystic River watershed for the benefit of all our community members. To achieve this, the Mystic River Watershed Association is protecting water quality, restoring important habitat, building climate resilience, transforming parks and paths, and inspiring youth and community members.

This talk is virtual, free, open to the public, and will feature a Q&A session with our speakers.

This talk is part of our **Continued Conversations** series in conjunction with our current environmental justice exhibition, [_More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/).
