### About this event

Join us with Dina Gilio-Whitaker for a conversation on indigenous land rights, environmental justice, and forms of resilience, featuring maps from our collections and excerpts from _The Penobscot: Ancestral River, Contested Territory_.

[Dina Gilio-Whitaker](https://dgwconsulting.org/#bio) (Colville Confederated Tribes descendant) is a renowned scholar, educator, journalist, and author in American Indian studies. In her most recent book _As Long As Grass Grows: The Indigenous Fight for Environmental Justice from Colonization to Standing Rock_ (Beacon Press, 2019), Dina applies her expertise in environmental justice to create a foundation for thinking through what environmental justice policy means in Indian country. The only book of its kind, it stands as a primer for governments and organizations of all kinds who are engaging in environmental justice work with Indigenous peoples.

This talk is part of our **Continued Conversations** series in conjunction with our current environmental justice exhibition, [_More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape_.](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/)

To be held **in person** at the [Central Library](https://www.bpl.org/locations/3/) in Copley Square.
