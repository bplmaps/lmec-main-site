### Commit to working on your writing project this summer with an in-person writing group at the Leventhal Center

In Summer 2022, the Leventhal Center invites graduate students, early career scholars, and other writers working on projects related to history and geography topics to convene for a six-session writing group in the Center's classroom space, at the Central Library in Copley Square. Each session will run from **9:30-11:30 am, biweekly on Tuesdays, beginning June 14**. Free coffee and tea will be provided for writers. Each session will include 10 minutes at the beginning and end for participants to share progress on one anothers' projects, but otherwise the time will be set aside for quiet writing.

We ask that all participants commit to attending at least four of the dates:

* June 14
* June 28
* July 12
* July 26
* August 9
* August 23

Applications will be accepted in the order they are received, up to a maximum of 16 participants.
