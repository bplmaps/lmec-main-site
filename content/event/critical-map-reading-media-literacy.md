### Small Bites: Critical Map Reading & Media Literacy

For the 2021-22 school year the Map Center is offering a series of FREE “small bites” professional development sessions foregrounding teaching about Boston through a social justice lens, though the sessions are easily adaptable to other municipalities. These 6 sessions will run after school and will be a mix of in-person and Zoom sessions designed to send you off with great map-based lessons and resources to immediately implement in your classroom. All K-12 teachers are welcome. Sign up for one or all of them!

Maps are a type of media students will come across often. Try out a mini-lesson designed to give students the tools to be critical map readers. We’ll also share a research protocol for students looking for maps online to help them assess if they trust what the map is showing and how to ask critical questions.
