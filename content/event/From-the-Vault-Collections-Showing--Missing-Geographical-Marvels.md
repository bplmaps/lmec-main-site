### About this event

***El Dorado, Hy-Brasil, the Mountains of the Moon - fancy taking a visit?***

It’s difficult to imagine these fantastic places hiding right under our noses, but historic cartographers often made maps of places that only existed as hopes and dreams. In this From The Vault, we’ll explore these geography mistakes and the history behind them. This showing is specially curated by our ﻿Reference & Cataloging Librarian, Lauren Chen!

This drop-in showing will be hosted Friday, May 31 from 2-4 pm in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions.

No advance registration is required.

#### From The Vault

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, From The Vault, attempts to remedy that limitation. From The Vault is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
