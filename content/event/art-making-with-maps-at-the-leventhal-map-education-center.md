### **Art Making with Maps**

### Mapping Layers of Information 

##### Thursday, April 21 10:30AM â€“ 12:30PM

Let's consider the different types of information every place has to offer us! We will start together with a short lesson about maps and then head outside to gather information about a nearby public space. We'll come back to the Map Center and create a large collaborative map from the geographic data you collect.

Designed for ages 8 and up.
