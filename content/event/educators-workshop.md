### About this event

Educators from the [Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center](https://www.leventhalmap.org/) at the Boston Public Library will discuss [“Activism in Boston Over Time,”](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/for_educators/primary_source_sets/activism_in_boston_over_time) a new primary source set and an accompanying lesson they created for Digital Commonwealth. In this lesson, students use maps, photos and other resources to construct a narrative of how different locations in Boston changed over time and the role of activism in the change. This lesson can serve as a model for any educators across the Commonwealth considering how to teach about the role of citizen action in their local communities.

**Come prepared to participate as we'll be trying out the lesson together!**

This workshop is designed for K-12 educators but anyone interested in this topic is invited to participate.

The workshop is free of charge. Please register by Tuesday, September 27. You will receive the Zoom link when you register.
