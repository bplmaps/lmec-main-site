### **_Small Bites: Educator Social and Map Giveaway_**

For the 2021-22 school year the Map Center is offering a series of FREE “small bites” professional development sessions foregrounding teaching about Boston through a social justice lens, though the sessions are easily adaptable to other municipalities. These 6 sessions will run after school and will be a mix of in-person and Zoom sessions designed to send you off with great map-based lessons and resources to immediately implement in your classroom. All K-12 teachers are welcome. Sign up for one or all of them!

Our first get-together is an opportunity for you to meet us and each other, tour our new exhibition [Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception](https://www.leventhalmap.org/education/k12/professional-development/), load up your vehicle with free classroom maps (from class sets to beautiful large wall maps of the world), and enjoy some small bites! We'll be here from 3:00 to 5:30 pm. Drop in and stay as little or as long as you like!
