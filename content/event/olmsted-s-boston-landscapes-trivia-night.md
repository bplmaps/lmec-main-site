### About this event

What do you know about Frederick Law Olmsted and his legacies in Boston landscapes? Join us with the [Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site](https://www.nps.gov/frla/index.htm) and [Friends of Fairsted](https://friendsoffairsted.org/) for a trivia night on all things Olmsted!

Trivia rounds will feature a geographic scavenger hunt using Atlascope, knowledge about Olmsted's projects, life, and more!

Registration is encouraged but not required. You may participate individually or as a member of a team. This event will be held in person in the Newsfeed Café at the [Central Library](https://www.bpl.org/locations/3/) in Copley Square.

Prizes of maps will be awarded to winning teams!

This trivia series is in conjunction with our current environmental justice exhibition, [More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape]().
