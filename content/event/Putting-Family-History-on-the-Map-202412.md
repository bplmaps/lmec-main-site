Join guest speaker **Julia Williams** from the Leventhal Map & Education Center as she discusses the use of historic maps for genealogical research. She will provide a demo of Leventhal Center's Atlascope tool, which overlays historic maps on top of modern-day ones so you can easily compare past and present.

**Julia Williams** (she/her) is the Gallery & Communications Coordinator at the Leventhal Map & Education Center with interests in social, cultural, and local history. She has experience working with New England Historical Genealogical Society as a genealogist on the 10 Million Names project, a project aimed at recovering the names of the estimated ten million men, women, and children of African descent who were enslaved in pre- and post-colonial America. In her work at the Leventhal Center, she highlights the way local community-centered information can strengthen our knowledge, perception, and understanding of different historic material. She earned both her MA in Museum Education and her BA in Education & Human Development from Tufts University.
