Join the philosopher [Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò](http://www.olufemiotaiwo.com) for a discussion of his new book _Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity Politics (And Everything Else)_. His work explores the process by which a radical concept can be stripped of its political substance and liberatory potential by becoming the victim of elite capture—deployed by political, social, and economic elites in the service of their own interests.

**Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò** is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Georgetown University. He is the author of _Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity Politics (And Everything Else)_ and _Reconsidering Reparations_. His work exploring the intersections of climate justice and colonialism has been featured in _The New Yorker, The Nation, Boston Review, Dissent, The Appeal, Slate, Al Jazeera, The New Republic, Aeon_, and _Foreign Policy_.
