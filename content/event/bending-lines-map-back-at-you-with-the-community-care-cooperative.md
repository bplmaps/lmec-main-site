#### Join us as we unpack a project in persuasive cartography

As part of the [Bending Lines](https://leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines) exhibition initiative, we've started a project called **Map Back At You**, where we partner with community groups to create persuasive maps. These maps take data, design, and visual communication and put them in service of an argument, showing that maps are hardly just matter-of-fact reference tools.

In this series, we take a look at how we made these maps, starting with a brainstorm and ending with a finished map. Our first episode features staff from the [Community Care Cooperative](https://www.communitycarecooperative.org) who worked with us to create a map showing disparities in access to telehealth resources in Massachusetts. The final map, entitled _Bridging the Health Equity Divide_, combines Census data with locations of community healthcare clinics to show how nonprofit health centers are working to provide services in communities where Internet access is limited.

This event will be streamed on [YouTube Live](https://www.youtube.com/c/LeventhalMapEducationCenter) and [Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/bplmaps/).
