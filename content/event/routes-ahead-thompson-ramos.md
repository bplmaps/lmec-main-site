### About this event

In our Spring 2024 conversation series **Routes Ahead of Us**, we take the themes of our current exhibition [*Getting Around Town: Mapping Four Centuries of Boston in Transit*](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/) and connect the history of Boston's transit system with questions about how to build a better, more equitable urban mobility system in the future.

These informal presentations feature discussions with transit and mobility experts, drinks and refreshments at the Boston Public Library's Newsfeed Café, and tours of _Getting Around Town_ following the conclusion of the program.
