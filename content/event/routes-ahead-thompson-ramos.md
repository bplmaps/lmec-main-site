{{\< alert-box type="warning" >}} This event has been **rescheduled **from its original date. {{\< /alert-box >}}

### About this event

In our Spring 2024 conversation series **Routes Ahead of Us**, we take the themes of our current exhibition *[Getting Around Town: Mapping Four Centuries of Boston in Transit](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/)* and connect the history of Boston's transit system with questions about how to build a better, more equitable urban mobility system in the future.

These informal presentations feature discussions with transit and mobility experts, drinks and refreshments at the Boston Public Library's Newsfeed Café, and tours of *Getting Around Town* following the conclusion of the program.

**Stacy Thompson** is the Executive Director of LivableStreets, overseeing all programs including Vision Zero, Better Buses, and the Emerald Network, and ensuring overall programmatic and operational excellence for the organization. A relentless optimist, Stacy is undaunted by the many challenges facing Metro Boston today, including increasing access to jobs and affordable housing, improving safety and public health outcomes, and building climate resiliency. Stacy believes that improving our streets isn't simply a transportation issue, but one of justice, equity, and opportunity.
