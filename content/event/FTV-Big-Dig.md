### About this event

{{< figure src="https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com/lmec-public-files/images/thirdharbortunne01mass_0197.jpg" caption="A map overlaying the routes of the Central Artery and Third Harbor Tunnel atop Boston's seventeenth-century shoreline, from [the project's 1985 environmental impact statement](https://archive.org/details/thirdharbortunne01mass/page/145/mode/1up)" class="figure-right" >}}

Have you been listening to GBH's [The Big Dig Podcast](https://www.wgbh.org/podcasts/the-big-dig)? Have you noticed how many times the podcast refers to maps of all kinds? Do you want to look at the documents behind the Big Dig—both the maps that made the project happen as well as maps showing possibilities that never came to be?

Join us for a *From the Vault* collections showing with [Ian Coss](https://iancoss.com), the producer of _The Big Dig_ podcast, as we pull out some of the most important maps for understanding "the most expensive highway project ever built in America." From the early plans to develop Interstate highways in the Boston region all the way through the ongoing attempts to deal with some of the project's most challenging effects, this From the Vault program will echo a key theme from our current exhibition *Getting Around Town: Mapping Four Centuries of Boston in Transit*: to understand today's transportation challenges, we must look into the past.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.
