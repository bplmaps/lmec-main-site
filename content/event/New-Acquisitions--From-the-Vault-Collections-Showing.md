***Calling all cartography lovers!*** Prepare to see some of the newest acquisitions to our collection of over 250,00 maps, atlases, globes, and other cartographic objects. Some chosen for their visual impact, others for their depictions of space and place, and even more for their interpretation of history and relevant information, these maps are sure to educate and impress.

This free showing will be hosted Friday, January 10 in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
