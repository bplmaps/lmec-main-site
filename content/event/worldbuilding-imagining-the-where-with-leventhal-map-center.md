### About this event 

Join the Childrenâ€™s Library and the Leventhal Map & Education Center to learn how maps can help shape imaginary worlds. Explore examples from a few fantasy and science fiction books before creating your own. After learning some map lingo and thinking about settings in stories, you will have lots of materials to choose from to make a map to take with you. _Ages 8-12_
