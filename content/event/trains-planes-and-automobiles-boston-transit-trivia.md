### About this event

What was Boston's first public transit line? In what year did it begin operations?

Join the [Leventhal Map and Education Center](https://www.leventhalmap.org/) with the [Massachusetts Historical Society](https://www.masshist.org/) for a trivia night on Boston's transit history.

Trivia rounds will feature a geographic scavenger hunt using [Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/), knowledge about the city's rails, routes, streets, stations, and more!

Registration is encouraged but not required. You may participate individually or as a member of a team. This event will be held in person in the Newsfeed Café at the [Central Library](https://www.bpl.org/locations/3/) in Copley Square.

Prizes of maps will be awarded to winning teams!

\~Hint\~ You may want to review [this video](https://www.leventhalmap.org/event/steven-beaucher-on-boston-in-transit/) in preparation.
