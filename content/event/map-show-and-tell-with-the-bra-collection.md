With nearly 200 newly-digitized items documenting urban transformation in 20th century, the [Boston Redevelopment Authority Collection](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/collections/commonwealth:7h14cv132) opens up a new window into [urban change in Boston](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/a-new-view-into-urban-renewal-in-boston/). Join us for an informal Show-and-Tell session, where we'll look at some of the maps in the collection that our staff members—and you!—find most interesting. If you want, come ready to share a map from the collection that strikes your interest. It could be a map where you know a hidden story about its context, a map that you have questions about or strikes your curiosity, or it could be an example of how to use these BRA maps in a project. This will be an informal participatory session, and we welcome visitors with no prior experience in Boston historical research or digital map collections.
