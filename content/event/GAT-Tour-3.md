### About this event

Join us for a tour of our new exhibition, [Getting Around Town: Four Centuries of Mapping Boston in Transit](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/), with guest curator Steven Beaucher.

#### About Getting Around Town

How do Bostonians get from here to there in a city full of trains, trolleys, ferries, and more? Whether in the familiar colored lines of today’s MBTA map or the complicated timetables of long-vanished omnibus routes, maps have long been an indispensable instrument for getting around town. This exhibition features an extraordinary collection of transit maps dating from the seventeenth century to the present, and invites questions about how people have moved around the city in the past, present, and future.

Steven Beaucher is the guest curator of the *Getting Around Town* exhibition. He is the co-founder and proprietor of WardMaps LLC, dealing in antique maps and public transportation artifacts of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Steven established and operates MBTAgifts, the licensed merchandise program of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Steven is a licensed architect, who, before focusing on WardMaps and the creation of Boston in Transit, practiced architecture throughout Greater Boston. He grew up in the Merrimack Valley, graduated from Syracuse University, and resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

*This program is free and open to members of the public. Registration is required*.
