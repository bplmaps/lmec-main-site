Curious to see what Boston looked like at the turn of the twentieth century?

During this edition of *From the Vault*, we’ll have the iconic 1906 film *Seeing Boston* playing in our classroom, accompanied by maps and other objects from BPL Special Collections that help animate the places seen in the film.

This drop-in showing will be hosted Friday, October 11 from 2-4 pm in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions. This collections showing event was specially curated by friend of the Center, **Gerald A. Rosenthal**.

No advance registration is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
