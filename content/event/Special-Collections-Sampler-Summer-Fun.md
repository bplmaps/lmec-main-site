### About this event

***Get into your Summer mindset with Special Collections by stopping by and exploring items from our collections that highlight Summer Fun through the years! ***    

One of the best parts of Summer is being able to get out in the sunshine and enjoy the long, beautiful days! Whether it’s heading to the beach, taking in a baseball game, or loading up the car for a family road trip, there’s nothing like Summer.   

The following items will be available for the month of July to use in the Special Collections reading room (Wednesday through Friday 9:30 am to 4:30 pm). No appointment necessary.   

Items available include:   

* A selection of photographs of barrier-breaking baseball legends Jacky Robinson and Satchel Paige playing in and visiting Boston. Photographs from the Boston Herald-Traveler Photo Morgue.
* Mixer’s Motor Maps and Tours, Automobile Map of New England Showing the Ideal Tour (1925), which charts an “ideal tour” around New England at a time when the road trip was exploding in popularity. *New acquisition, 2023*.  
* A 16th century treatise on swimming, with unique woodcut illustrations that show different swimming techniques such as how to safely enter and exit rivers!
* Handmade children’s book *Other Sandy Cove Stories* (1931) by Hildegard Woodward, which recounts summer visits to children’s book author and editor Alice Dalgliesh’s country home in Sandy Cove, Nova Scotia.
* *An Impression of Summer: A Landscape Panorama* (1966), a handmade book that combines elements of offset and nature printing to layer shapes, colors, and textures into each seasonal panorama.
