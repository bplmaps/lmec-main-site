### About this event 

One of the best parts of Summer is being able to get out in the sunshine and enjoy the long, beautiful days! Whether it’s heading to the beach, taking in a baseball game, or loading up the car for a family road trip, there’s nothing like Summer. Get into your Summer mindset with Special Collections by stopping by and exploring items from our collections that highlight Summer Fun through the years!     

The following items will be available for the month of July to use in the Special Collections reading room (Wednesday through Friday 9:30 am to 4:30 pm). No appointment necessary.   

Items available include:   

* A selection of photographs of barrier-breaking baseball legends Jacky Robinson and Satchel Paige playing in and visiting Boston. Photographs from the Boston Herald-Traveler Photo Morgue.
* Mixer’s Motor Maps and Tours, Automobile Map of New England Showing the Ideal Tour (1925), which charts an “ideal tour” around New England at a time when the road trip was exploding in popularity. New acquisition, 2023.  
* A 16th century treatise on swimming, with unique woodcut illustrations that show different swimming techniques such as how to safely enter and exit rivers!
* Handmade children’s book Other Sandy Cove Stories (1931) by Hildegard Woodward, which recounts summer visits to children’s book author and editor Alice Dalgliesh’s country home in Sandy Cove, Nova Scotia.
* An Impression of Summer: A Landscape Panorama (1966), a handmade book that combines elements of offset and nature printing to layer shapes, colors, and textures into each seasonal panorama.
