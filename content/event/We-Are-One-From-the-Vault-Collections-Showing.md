**We're bringing back the best elements of one of our most popular exhibitions, *[We Are One: Mapping America's Road from Revolution to Independence](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/3)*, to celebrate this Independence Day.** 

*We Are One* maps the American road to independence and explores the tumultuous events that led thirteen colonies to join to forge a new nation. Using geographic and cartographic perspectives, the exhibition traces the American story from the strife of the French and Indian War to the creation of a new national government and the founding of Washington, D.C. as its home.

This free showing will be hosted **Thursday, July 3** in the Leventhal Map & Education Center with a staff member available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing.

Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
