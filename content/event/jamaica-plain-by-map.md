### Event description

#### Join the Leventhal Map & Education Center, the JP branch of BPL, and the JP Historical Society as we explore history through maps.

How old is the JP branch of the library? What was Jamaica Plain like in the late 19th and early 20th centuries? How has the neighborhood changed, and how has it stayed the same? Using [Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/), the Leventhal Map & Education Center’s user-friendly portal for exploring urban atlases, we’ll dive into the historical geography of Jamaica Plain. Come learn about how the community has changed over time, and discover how to research the history of your own house and neighborhood.

This event will be broadcast online at the Leventhal Map Center’s [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7XDT7zQeq493V8E6SNw-g) Live and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bplmaps/live_videos) Live channels.
