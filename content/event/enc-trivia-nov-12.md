### What do you know about the Emerald Necklace and maps of parks in Boston? Bring yourself or a team to our trivia night!

The Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library and the Emerald Necklace Conservancy invite you to LMEC's third virtual trivia night, where we challenge you to learn more about the history of the city of Boston.

Some of the trivia rounds will feature a geographic scavenger hunt using Atlascope, the Map Center's user-friendly tool that provides access to hundreds of historic maps of Boston and surrounding areas. Others will feature knowledge about Frederick Law Olmsted's 100-year-old park system, the Emerald Necklace.

Registration is encouraged but not required. You may participate individually or as a member of a team. Teams are responsible for their own coordination over chat or phone to submit answers.

This event will be livestreamed on the Leventhal Map & Education Center's Facebook and YouTube pages.

Prizes of maps of Boston and of the Emerald Necklace will be awarded to winning teams.
