### See more maps of an infamous border dispute

A complicated map of the Rio Grande's shifting course is [on exhibit in _Bending Lines_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/power-belief/3.3.5/) as part of our discussion about the power of maps to determine the edges of national inclusion and identity. 

In this behind-the-scenes curatorial tour, we'll look at more maps of the Chamizal dispute from the same portfolio of reports from the International Boundary Commission that produced this colorful river map.
