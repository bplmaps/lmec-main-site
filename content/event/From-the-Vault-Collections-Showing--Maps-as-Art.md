### About this event

This week we’ll explore the ways in which maps use art and masterful artistry in order to tell a story through mapmaking! From the 16th century to modern day, view the ways in which art has influenced map making since the beginning.

This drop-in showing will be hosted Friday, April 26 from 2-4 pm in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions. 

No advance registration is required.

#### From The Vault

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, From The Vault, attempts to remedy that limitation. From The Vault is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
