### About this event

Looking to add more maps to your life? Join us for an afternoon of close map looking! The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, _From the Vault_, attempts to remedy that limitation.

**_From The Vault _**is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions **do not** include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be present to interpret the objects, chat, and answer questions.

_Registration is not required. If you would like to receive event reminders, please register on this_ [_Eventbrite page_](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/from-the-vault-10212022-tickets-439625340227)_._
