**[Ian Spangler](https://itspangler.com/)** is a cultural & economic geographer with interests in digital mapping, housing studies, and race & landscape in the US. He currently serves as the *Assistant Curator of Digital & Participatory Geography* at the Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library. He holds a PhD in Geography from the University of Kentucky.

At this session of *Data + Donuts*, Ian will present his [dissertation research](https://itspangler.com/research/platform-real-estate/) exploring how spatial data standardization practices shape the design and use of real estate technologies. Focusing on housing in the U.S. real estate industry, Ian asks: how do standards, standardizing practices, and the institutions that enforce those practices affect housing?

Ian's talk will be given in a hybrid format. Register to receive a link to join via Zoom. In-person attendees can join us in Wexner 434. Those without an HUID may enter via the Wexner security desk after showing a photo ID. [View a map of campus](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/more/contact-us#maps-directions).
