### **_Small Bites: Environmental Justice in Boston_**

For the 2021-22 school year the Map Center is offering a series of FREE “small bites” professional development sessions foregrounding teaching about Boston through a social justice lens, though the sessions are easily adaptable to other municipalities. These 6 sessions will run after school and will be a mix of in-person and Zoom sessions designed to send you off with great map-based lessons and resources to immediately implement in your classroom. All K-12 teachers are welcome. Sign up for one or all of them!

For our final session of the school year, we’ll explore education connections to our upcoming exhibition _More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape._ Explore how environmental harm is borne unequally by different communities, both in the past and the present, and consider how to foster placed-based environmental thinking in students that is coupled with social justice via a map-based lesson.
