When reading maps, we expect map makers to use standard conventions, especially in regard to map projection or composition, orientation, scale, and symbols. But what about those times when a map maker does things a bit differently than expected? What is the story the map maker is trying to tell?

In this From the Vault collections showing, each map highlights a variety of unconventional cartographic styles spanning the history of the printed map. 

This free showing will be hosted Friday, December 6 in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
