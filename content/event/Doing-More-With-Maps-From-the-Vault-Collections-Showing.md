The Leventhal Center is thrilled to welcome educators attending the National Council for Social Studies Conference.

For this edition of From the Vault, conference attendees, fans of social studies, and the general public can view a selection of maps from the collection that go beyond your standard textbook map. We share maps that encourage us to think about how who made or paid for the creation of each map impacts what is depicted (or excluded).

Selected maps will also include questions for educators to bring back to the classrooms as they consider maps as primary sources.

This free showing will be hosted Friday, November 22 in the Learning Center with staff members from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
