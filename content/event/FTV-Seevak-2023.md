### About this event

Looking to add more maps to your life? Join us for an afternoon of close map looking! This edition of *From The Vault* will be curated by our Summer 2023 Seevak Fellows, [Salman Uddin](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/salman-uddin/) and [Zoe Colimon](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/people/zoe-colimon/). We’ll take a look at objects from our collections that show different kinds of map projections — and if you loved our 2020-21 exhibition *[Bending Lines: Maps and Data From Distortion to Deception](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/),* this event is for you!

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM.

##### From The Vault

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
