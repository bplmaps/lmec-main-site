Join us for a special evening exclusively for educators at the Leventhal Center to explore our current exhibition,Â *Processing Place*.

Together with the exhibition co-curator and Assistant Curator of Digital & Participatory Geography, **Ian Spangler**, consider how computer mapping has shaped our understanding of the world around us.

Light refreshments will be served. Space is limited to 16 participants.
