11th and 12th grade students at the Jeremiah Burke High School in Dorchester are working with educators from the Leventhal Map & Education Center in a one-semester elective class that focuses on the key question: “How do racial ideas become spatial practice?”

Using Boston as the focus, students will explore their own and other Boston neighborhoods, in the past and present, and explore the role of race in policies that affect housing, transportation, gentrification among many other topics using maps and digital mapping. Educators and students from the class will talk about their research and work and show some of the maps they have created as part of their final project.
