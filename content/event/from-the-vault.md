### About this event

Looking to add more maps to your life? Join us for an afternoon of close map looking! The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. For this session of _From the Vault_, we'll take a look at objects recently featured on our social media pages! For a sneak peak, check out _bplmaps_ on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.

_Registration not required. Drop by any time between 2:00PM and 4:00PM._
