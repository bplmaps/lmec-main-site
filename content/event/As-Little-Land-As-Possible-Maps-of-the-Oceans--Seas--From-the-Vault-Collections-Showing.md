Though over 70% of the planet's surface is covered in water, few stop to think about how we map this huge segment of the Earth (and how important it is we do so). From detailing the best maritime trade routes to documenting exploratory journeys across the sea, maps of our largest bodies of water can push the boundaries of "conventional" map making. 

In this From The Vault, take a look at some of our maps featuring as little land as possible and see all that's left to uncover.

This free showing will be hosted Friday, March 21 in the Leventhal Map & Education Center with a staff member available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. 

Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
