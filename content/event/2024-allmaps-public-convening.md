The Leventhal Map & Education Center and American Geographical Society Library are jointly hosting a virtual forum on the Allmaps software ecosystem. [Allmaps](https://allmaps.org) is a set of open-source digital humanities tools that makes overlaying historic maps on modern geographies—a process commonly known as "georeferencing"—easier and more fun. The virtual forum is geared towards a wide range of potential users, from DH researchers to educators and librarians. It is completely free.
