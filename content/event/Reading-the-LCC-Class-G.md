### About this event

Join us for a Special Edition of *Reading the LCC*! This month, we're reading nonfiction from the G Class, which includes Geography, Anthropology, and Recreation and members of the LMEC staff will be joining the Lower Mills Branch for the discussion.

*Reading the LCC* is a book group where we explore the Library of Congress Classification system from Class A (General Works) to Class Z (Bibliography, Library Science). Unlike a traditional book club, readers are welcome to explore any title that interests you within the month’s category, and read as much or as little as you please. 

For inspiration and recommendations, check out the [BPL\_Reading the LCC: Class G](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/list/share/2084534949_bostonpl_elisec/2326797353_reading_the_lcc_class_g_-_geography,_anthropology,_recreation) booklist on [bpl.org](https://www.bpl.org/).
