### About this event

Join the Leventhal Map and Education Center with a panel of invited guests for a roundtable discussion on narratives of environmental justice. The roundtable will discuss how investigating historical and present-day patterns of urban inequality, and documenting these patterns through narrative and visual works, bring an important perspective to bear on efforts for climate justice organizing.

For this roundtable, we’re thrilled to be joined by:

* [Dr. Tracy Corley](https://www.clf.org/about/our-team/tracy-corley), Director of Research and Partnerships at [Conservation Law Foundation](https://www.clf.org/). Dr. Corley brings experience in research, public policy, law, and sustainability to the new role and thrives on bringing people together to tackle the complex issues that drive climate action and environmental justice. Dr. Corley also lectures part-time at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), is a Grist Fixer, and is a Biden-administration appointee to the Social and Community Science subcommittee of the EPA’s [Board of Scientific Councilors](https://www.epa.gov/bosc) (BOSC). Dr. Corley holds a BA in Architecture, an MS in Public Policy, and a Ph.D. in Law and Public Policy.
* [Chad Monterie](https://www.uml.edu/fahss/history/faculty/montrie-chad.aspx), professor in the [History Department at the University of Massachusetts Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/fahss/history/), where he teaches courses on American Environmental History, Food in American History, Radicalism in American History, Malcolm X, Historical Methods, and other topics. He is also the author of five books, including _Whiteness in Plain View: A History of Racial Exclusion in Minnesota_ (2022), _The Myth of Silent Spring: Rethinking the Origins of American Environmentalism_ (2018), and _To Save the Land and People: A History of Opposition to Surface Coal Mining in Appalachia_ (2003). Most recently, he was selected for a Fulbright Canada Research Chair at the University of Calgary, 2022-23.

This event will be held **in person** in the Commonwealth Salon, [Central Library](https://www.bpl.org/locations/3/).
