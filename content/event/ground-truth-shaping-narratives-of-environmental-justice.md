### About this event

Join the [Leventhal Map and Education Center](https://www.leventhalmap.org/) with a panel of invited guests for a roundtable discussion on narratives of environmental justice. The roundtable will discuss how investigating historical and present-day patterns of urban inequality, and documenting these patterns through narrative and visual works, bring an important perspective to bear on efforts for climate justice organizing.

This event will be held **in person** in the Commonwealth Salon, [Central Library](https://www.bpl.org/locations/3/). We invite you to visit the Map Center’s current exhibition, [_More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/), before the discussion.
