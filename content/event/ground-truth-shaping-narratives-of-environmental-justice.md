### About this event

Join the Leventhal Map and Education Center with a panel of invited guests for a roundtable discussion on narratives of environmental justice. The roundtable will discuss how investigating historical and present-day patterns of urban inequality, and documenting these patterns through narrative and visual works, bring an important perspective to bear on efforts for climate justice organizing.

For this roundtable, we’re thrilled to be joined by:

* Chad Monterie,
* Tracy Corley,
* 

This event will be held in person in the Commonwealth Salon, Central Library. We invite you to visit the Map Center’s current exhibition, [_More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/)_,_ before or after the discussion.

Presented as part of [Climate Preparedness Week 2022.](https://www.climatecrew.org/climate_prep_week_2022?locale=en)
