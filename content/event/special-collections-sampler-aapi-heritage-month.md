### About this event

To celebrate **Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month**, Special Collections invites you to explore and interact with Asian American and Pacific Islander authors and creators throughout our collections!

Join us on **Tuesday, May 2 from 2:00PM – 4:00PM** for a special Open House where staff will be available to answer questions as you explore collection items up close. 

Items available include:

* Photographs by conceptual artist Kenji Nakahashi
* A Marshall Islands stick chart used to show the locations of islands, currents, and ocean swells in the South Pacific
* A letter from Yone Noguchi, the first Japanese writer to publish poetry in English
* _One Cent Life_, a book of poetry and art compiled by Chinese-American poet and artist Walasse Ting. Included in the book are print by artists such as Sam Francis, Joan Mitchell, Andy Warhol, and Kiki Kogelni

_Can’t make it? These items will be available for the month of May to use in the Special Collections reading room (Wednesday to Friday 9:30AM to 4:30PM). No appointment necessary._
