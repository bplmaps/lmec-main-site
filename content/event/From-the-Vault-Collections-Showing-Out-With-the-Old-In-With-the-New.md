As the technology that we use improves and advances, so too do the things we can create with that technology. Maps in the modern day look drastically different than those used several hundred years ago, and are now able to tell us a multitude of different things than they could previously. 

But what do these changes actually look like? How has the process of digitizing cartography evolved how we communicate our place in the world? And how do maps from hundreds of years ago compare to the maps we use to navigate our world today? 

Come see for yourself during “Out With the Old, In With the New” From the Vault!

This drop-in showing will be hosted Friday, October 25 from 2-4 pm in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions. 

No advance registration is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
