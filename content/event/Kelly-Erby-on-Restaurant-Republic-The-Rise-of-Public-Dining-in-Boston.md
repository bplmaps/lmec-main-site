### About this event

J﻿oin us on Monday, August 14 at 12:00PM EDT with **Dr. Kelly Erby** for a virtual talk on her book, *[Restaurant Republic: The Rise of Public Dining in Boston](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/restaurant-republic)*.

Before the 1820s, the vast majority of Americans ate only at home. As the nation began to urbanize and industrialize, home and work became increasingly divided, resulting in new forms of commercial dining. *Restaurant Republic* sheds light on how commercial dining both reflected and helped shape growing fragmentation along lines of race, class, and gender—from the elite Tremont House, which served fashionable French cuisine, to such plebeian and ethnic venues as oyster saloons and Chinese chop suey houses
