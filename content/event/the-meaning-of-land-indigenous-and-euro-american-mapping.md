#### Join us for a remote program at Phillips Academy

How can maps reflect the world-view and relationships to the land of their creators? Look closely and engage with maps made by both Native and Euro-American cartographers. This interactive virtual workshop will incorporate close looking, sketching and discussion of maps and art from the Sidney R. Knafel Map Collection at Phillips Academy as well as others. Led by Michelle LeBlanc, Director of Education at the Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library in collaboration with the Addison Gallery of American Art inspired by the exhibition, "Wayfinding: Contemporary Artists, Critical Dialogues, and the Sidney R. Knafel Map Collection." This is a free program but space is limited and advance signup is required.
