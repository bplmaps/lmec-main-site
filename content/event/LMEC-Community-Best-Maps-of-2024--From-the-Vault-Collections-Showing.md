If you've ever wondered which of our maps are the most popular with visitors and researchers, here's your chance! 

At the LMEC, we have over a quarter million maps in our collection and more than 14,000 digitized and available through our digital collection portal. We've run the numbers and in this From the Vault we're here to show you some of our most popular maps of the last year! There's some maps that remain ever popular, but there are certainly some maps that may surprise you. See if you can guess which was the most viewed!

This free showing will be hosted Friday, December 20 in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
