##### Hosted by the Massachusetts Civic Learning Coalition as part of Massachusetts Civic Learning Week

[Massachusetts Civic Learning Week](https://www.macivicsforall.org/clw2022) seeks to empower all of us to see ourselves as participants and changemakers in our democracy. The weekâ€™s events will highlight the voices of youth and teachers.

This session will discuss the role of maps and digital mapping when exploring ideas of community and addressing social issues. We'll touch on a recent 2-week course with seniors at the [Margarita Muniz Academy](https://munizacademy.org/), highlight several lessons plans, and spotlight student projects.
