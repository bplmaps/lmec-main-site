### About this event

Celebrate Pride Month with Special Collections by stopping by and exploring items from our collections spotlighting LGBTQIA+ culture and history!   

Join us on Tuesday, June 6 from 2:00 pm – 4:00 pm for a special Open House where staff will be available to answer questions as you explore collection items up close; no reservation required.   

Items available include:  

* A Historical Map of Lesbian and Gay Boston (1995), highlighting more than 60 sites in the Boston area related to LGBTQIA+ history. 
* The score of the opera Peter Grimes, written and autographed by English gay composer Benjamin Britten.
* An extremely rare edition of a 1611 stage play that fictionalized the life of Mary Frith, a woman who defied the gender binary of 17th century London by dressing, acting, and living in ways that were at the time reserved only for men.
* Wanderfolk in Wonderland (1903), a children’s book written by former North End librarian Edith Guerrier and illustrated by her partner Edith Brown.

Can’t make it? These items will be available for the month of June to use in our reading room (Wednesday through Friday 9:30 am to 4:30 pm). No appointment necessary.
