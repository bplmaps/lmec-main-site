### Explore Boston through the lens of historic urban atlases

{{< figure src="/uploads/2023-02-23/screen-shot-2023-02-23-at-9-29-36-am.png" caption="What will you discover in [Atlascope](https://www.atlascope.org/)?" class="figure-right" >}}

The Leventhal Center has an extraordinary collection of [urban atlases](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&f%5Bcollection_name_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Urban+Maps+%28Collection+of+Distinction%29&f%5Bsubject_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Boston+%28Mass.%29--Maps&search_field=dummy_range&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=1860&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bend%5D=1950&commit=Apply) dating from the late 19th to early 20th centuries, one of the most important sets of documents for depicting how our city and region have changed over time. Our [Atlascope tool](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/) transforms 101 of these atlases into a web interface suitable for browsing on a computer or mobile device, making it easy to compare properties, buildings and owners to tell stories about places over time. With new features to empower storytelling, annotation, and discovery, as well as connections into other Massachusetts digital collections, Atlascope is a great tool to answer questions like:

* [Who owned the land in 1884 where Fenway Park sits today](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-71.09693,42.34659$zoom:17.75$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/al84rac0k)?
* [Which railroad lines had passenger terminals in 1883 at the site of today’s North Station](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-71.06230,42.36603$zoom:17.34$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/al8c28hx3)?
* [Did any women own land in what became Franklin Park in 1874](https://atlascope.org/#/view:share$mode:glass$center:-71.09516,42.30868$zoom:16.21$base:maptiler-streets$overlay:ark:/76611/al8c2h4jv)?

During Atlascope Office Hours, LMEC Staff will be available to answer questions, provide a demonstration of Atlascope features, troubleshoot atlas-based research inquiries, and more.

_Drop in anytime between 2:00PM – 4:00PM. Chromebooks will be provided._
