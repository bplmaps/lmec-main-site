In partnership with colleagues in BPL Special Collections, we are presenting a special *From the Vault* focused on the Boston Marathon and the finish line on Boylston Street.

The Boston Marathon has been run for 127 years, it is a tradition that brings athletes and spectators from around the globe to participate in one of the most iconic events in running. Over its long and storied history, though, the Marathon has changed quite a bit, from the distance run, to who could run the race.

We’ll be drawing from the BPL Special Collections and the Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center to learn a bit more about the history of the Marathon. Staff will be on hand to show you photographs and maps from the collections that illustrate how the Marathon has changed and evolved over its history.

Drop in any time between 10:00AM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.
