How do you change a system that was never designed to be equitable? J﻿oin us on Monday, October 16 at 12:00 pm EDT with Veronica O. Davis for a virtual talk on her book, [Inclusive Transportation: A Manifesto for Repairing Divided Communities](https://islandpress.org/books/inclusive-transportation). In [Inclusive Transportation: A Manifesto for Repairing Divided Communities](https://islandpress.org/books/inclusive-transportation), transportation expert Veronica O. Davis shines a light on the inequitable and often destructive practice of transportation planning and engineering. She calls for new thinking and more diverse leadership to create transportation networks that connect people to jobs, education, opportunities, and to each other.
