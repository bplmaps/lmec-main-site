### About this event

Boston Public Library's [Local & Family History Lecture Series](https://www.bpl.org/local-and-family-history-series/) shares information about the history of Boston and its diverse neighborhoods along with tips and guides for those beginning their own genealogical research.

How can we use historic maps for genealogical research?

Join Ian Spangler and Megan Nally from the Leventhal Map & Education Center as they discuss the use of historic maps for genealogical research. They will provide a demo of Leventhal Center's [Atlascope tool](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/), which overlays historic maps on top of modern-day ones so you can easily compare past and present.
