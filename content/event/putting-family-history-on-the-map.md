### About this event

How can we use historic maps for genealogical research?

Join Ian Spangler and Megan Nally from the Leventhal Map & Education Center as they discuss the use of historic maps for genealogical research. They will provide a demo of Leventhal Center's [Atlascope tool](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/), which overlays historic maps on top of modern-day ones so you can easily compare past and present.
