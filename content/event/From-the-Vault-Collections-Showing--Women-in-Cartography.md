### About this event

Women are active in all aspects of cartography today and are leaders in the world of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Join us to take a closer look at maps related to women’s history and works from women cartographers throughout time.

This free showing will be hosted Friday, March 1 in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

#### From The Vault

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, From The Vault, attempts to remedy that limitation. From The Vault is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
