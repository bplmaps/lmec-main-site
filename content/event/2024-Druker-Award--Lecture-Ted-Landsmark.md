Following the discussion there will be an audience Q\&A. Druker Company President **Ronald M. Druker** will give welcoming remarks.

**Ted Landsmark** has been a civic planner, civil rights and equity advocate, higher education administrator, arts and culture researcher, and community-engaged social activist in Boston and nationally. He serves on the leadership committee of the Northeastern University Faculty Senate and on the board of the Leventhal Map and Education Center.

As Director of the Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy, Professor Landsmark oversees inter-disciplinary research on urban policy matters, including housing, gentrification, economic development, civic engagement, school design, comprehensive services, transportation, resilience, and public service. Dr. Landsmark teaches the Open Classroom on community engagement in policy planning and design, racial equity and civic justice, and Capstone courses. He has convened an annual conference on equitable policy engagement.

As Mayor Walsh’s first appointment to the Boston Planning and Development Agency’s Board of Directors, Landsmark has brought to the board a wealth of expertise in architecture, urban design, civic leadership, architectural and construction law, and community advocacy. Since joining the board, the agency has rebranded, held hundreds of community meetings annually, planned and facilitated the development of over $50 billion in real estate including 35,000 housing units, \~30% of which have been income-restricted, and generated over $15 million in jobs training and affordable housing funds. During his seventeen-year tenure as president and CEO of the Boston Architectural College, Dr. Landsmark led the growth of the school from a design center into an internationally recognized, multi-disciplinary higher education institution.
