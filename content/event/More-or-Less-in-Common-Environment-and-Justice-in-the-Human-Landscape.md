### About this event

The climate crisis is a matter of environmental injustice; it is also a matter of historical injustice. How can historical visualizations illuminate past inequities, present realities, and future possibilities for adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change?

Human geographer Garrett Dash Nelson will explore the uneven distributions of harm, responsibility, vulnerability, and power, in both historical and local perspectives. The city of Boston and its environs will serve as a microcosm for the exploration of ways in which climate change will amplify a century’s worth of environmental injustice. Can historical visualizations help us to overcome the structuring effects of this legacy?
