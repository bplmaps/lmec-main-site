### About this event

As we enter the 250th year since America’s first fight to gain independence, we have an opportunity to reflect on our nation’s founding and on similar historic events of the past. Join us this Friday to examine maps that showcase the peoples, regions, and nations that worked to revolutionize their social structure and gain independence from those that sought to suppress their freedom.

This drop-in showing will be hosted Friday, July 5 from 2-4 pm in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions.

No advance registration is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, From The Vault, attempts to remedy that limitation. From The Vault is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
