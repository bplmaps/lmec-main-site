### About this event

Visited [Building Blocks of Boston](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/events/6388ce5755373a4100c51c93 "https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/events/6388ce5755373a4100c51c93") at the Leventhal Map & Education Center and want to see more? Special Collections is excited to invite all interested visitors during the month of March to see special objects from Rare Books, Arts, and the Map Center about Boston life from 1890-1930.

**We’ll be having a special Open House on Tuesday, March 14, from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm**. All are welcome to drop-in to see these collections up close to talk to staff about the objects. No reservations necessary.

Can't make it? They are available for the month of March to use in our reading room (Wednesday to Friday 9:30am to 4:30pm). No appointment necessary.

For the month of March, our sampler items include:

* A scrapbook of concert programs and related news clippings from the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s 1892-1893 season
* Clark’s Boston Blue Book showing exactly what people, clubs, and businesses were on Boston’s streets in 1899
* A diary from a Dorchester resident from 1884-1893
* A selection of photographs related to the original construction of the subway at Park Street
* An 1896 map of the central business district of Boston.
