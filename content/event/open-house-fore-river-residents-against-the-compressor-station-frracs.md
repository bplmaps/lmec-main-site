### About this event

Join [Fore River Residents Against the Compressor Station (FRRACS)](https://www.nocompressor.com/) for an Open House at the [Leventhal Map and Education Center](https://www.leventhalmap.org/) in the Boston Public Library’s [Central Branch](https://www.bpl.org/locations/3/) in Copley Square. Hear from residents of the Fore River Basin, on the South Shore of greater Boston, about their ongoing 7 1/2 year fight against Enbridge’s Weymouth Compressor Station. This Compressor Station, the only one in the United States to be located in a densely populated coastal area, poses a serious threat to the health, safety, environment, and economy of Greater Boston’s South Shore, and is sited adjacent to three Environmental Justice communities

Folks can explore the Leventhal Center exhibit in which FRRACS is featured, titled: [_More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/)_._ The exhibit also includes the stories of many other fights for environmental justice and the differences in environmental and social outcomes in different communities around the world, based on wealth, class, and race. The exhibit lets folks think critically about the environmental movement and relationship with environmental justice.

Registration is encouraged, though not required. For event reminders, please register.
