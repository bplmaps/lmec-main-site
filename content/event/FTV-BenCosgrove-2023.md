Looking to add more maps to your life? Join us for an afternoon of close map looking! 

This edition of *From The Vault *will be curated by Ben Cosgrove, a traveling composer-performer whose “compelling and beautiful” instrumental music explores themes of landscape, place, and environment. [Ben's music will be performed live on Friday, August 11 at 12:30PM as part of the Boston Public Library's Concerts in the Courtyard Series](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/events/64591a53ea132336001b43f6). We're thrilled to host Ben following the performance to talk through a handful of objects from our collections that relate to his work and themes of landscape, geography, and place.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM.

##### From The Vault

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
