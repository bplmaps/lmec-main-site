Dr. Dan O’Brien is Professor of Public Policy and Urban Affairs and Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University and Director of the Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI). His research focuses on equity in urban neighborhoods, including crime, environmental justice, and more. His three books, *[The Urban Commons](https://www.amazon.com/Urban-Commons-Technology-Rebuild-Communities/dp/0674975294)* (Harvard University Press; 2018), *[Urban Informatics](http://ui.danourban.com/)* (Chapman Hall / CRC Press; 2022), and *[The Pointillistic City](https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5893/The-Pointillistic-CityHow-Microspatial-Inequities)* (MIT Press; 2024), demonstrate the value of integrating data-driven science with community-oriented policy and practice.
