### About this event

What did Boston look like during the American Revolution? How can historic maps be used for genealogical research? How has Copley Square changed over time? Join the [Leventhal Map and Education Center](https://www.leventhalmap.org/ "Original URL: https://www.leventhalmap.org/. Click or tap if you trust this link.") for a deep dive on geographic research! This talk will introduce the Map Centerâ€™s resources, including a demonstration of the [Digital Collections](https://www.leventhalmap.org/collections/ "Original URL: https://www.leventhalmap.org/collections/. Click or tap if you trust this link.") portal and an optional tour of their current exhibition, [_More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/ "Original URL: https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/.

_Due to the ample seating available in the Rabb Lecture Hall, registration is not required; instead, seating is first come, first served._
