### About this event

In our Spring 2024 conversation series **Routes Ahead of Us**, we take the themes of our current exhibition [*Getting Around Town: Mapping Four Centuries of Boston in Transit*](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/) and connect the history of Boston's transit system with questions about how to build a better, more equitable urban mobility system in the future.

These informal presentations feature discussions with transit and mobility experts, drinks and refreshments at the Boston Public Library's Newsfeed Café, and tours of _Getting Around Town_ following the conclusion of the program.

### About the speakers

**Daniel Rosengard** is the Director of Transportation for Boston Public Schools.

### Registration

Registration for this free event is required. Walk-ins from the public will be allowed if space is available, but only registered guests will receive complimentary tickets for refreshments.

#### Program supporters

_Getting Around Town_ exhibition programming is supported by the Barr Foundation.
