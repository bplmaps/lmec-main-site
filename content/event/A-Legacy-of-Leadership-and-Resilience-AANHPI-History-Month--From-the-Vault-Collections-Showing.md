###### ***As Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month begins...***

...this *From The Vault* will examine the ways maps can support and inform Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander history across the globe and examine what it means for a map to be truly representative of a place and its people.

This free showing will be hosted Friday, May 2 in the Leventhal Map & Education Center with a staff member available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00 pm - 4:00 pm. No reservation is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing.

Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
