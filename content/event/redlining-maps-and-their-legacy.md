### Small Bites: Redlining Maps and Their Legacy

For the 2021-22 school year the Map Center is offering a series of FREE “small bites” professional development sessions foregrounding teaching about Boston through a social justice lens, though the sessions are easily adaptable to other municipalities. These 6 sessions will run after school and will be a mix of in-person and Zoom sessions designed to send you off with great map-based lessons and resources to immediately implement in your classroom. All K-12 teachers are welcome. Sign up for one or all of them!

Explore Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps of the 1930s and 40s and try out a lesson developed for the classroom using the [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58) interactive website. We will also look at the legacy of redlining with supplemental resources that explain the persistent disinvestment that resulted from the anti-Black and anti-immigrant bias accepted by the banking and real estate sectors at the time and the ways discrimination in these sectors continues today.
