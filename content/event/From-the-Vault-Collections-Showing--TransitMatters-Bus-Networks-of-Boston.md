### About this event

Join us for this From The Vault, in collaboration with TransitMatters, as we view historic MBTA transit maps of some of the most trouble-inducing routes of modern times. Buses, trains, trackless trolleys routes and more will be presented.

This free showing will be hosted Friday, March 29 in the Learning Center with a staff from TransitMatters and the Leventhal Center available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

#### From The Vault

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, From The Vault, attempts to remedy that limitation. From The Vault is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Map Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Map Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
