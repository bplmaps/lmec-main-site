In a fictional 1773, Johnny Tremain walked the streets of Boston. In reality in 1942, Esther Forbes used her extensive knowledge of the geography of colonial Boston to create an accurate world around her young protagonist to move through.

This workshop pairs this classic text with historic maps to connect students with Johnny Tremain and the very real world around him.
