### Our curator presents on Bending Lines, hosted by the Clements Library and the American Historical Print Collectors Society

Join historical geographer Garrett Dash Nelson from the Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library for a discussion about representation, reality, and the visualization of geographic information in the new exhibition _Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception_. Dr. Nelson will discuss not only the content of the exhibition itself but also the challenges and opportunities associated with creating digital exhibitions of historic printed material.
