Join LMEC Head Curator, **Garrett Dash Nelson**, for a special sneak preview exclusively for educators of our upcoming exhibition,Â *Terrains of Independence*. In this exhibition maps will offer the entry point to a reconsideration of the Revolutionary War through the lens of locality and place.

The exhibition will be on view at the Leventhal Center through January 2026 with special guided experiences for K-12 students available.
