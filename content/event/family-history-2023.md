### About this event

Join Ian Spangler and Megan Nally from the Leventhal Map & Education Center as they discuss the use of historic maps for genealogical research. They will provide a demo of Leventhal Center's Atlascope tool, which overlays historic maps on top of modern-day ones so you can easily compare past and present.

He is a geography PhD candidate at the University of Kentucky, and Assistant Curator of Digital & Participatory Geography at the Leventhal Map & Education Center.

Megan Nally is a recent graduate from Wesleyan University and holds a B.A. in Government and Hispanic Literatures & Cultures as well as a certificate in International Relations.
