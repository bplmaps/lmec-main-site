### **The Leventhal Map & Education Center and the Ashland Public Library explore Ashland's history and present through maps**

How has Ashland, Massachusetts changed over time? Where can we find the names and locations of buildings and landscapes that have now vanished? How can maps tell geographic stories?

Join the Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library and the Ashland Public Library for a virtual exploration of some of the best historic digital maps of Ashland and the region. We'll look at Ashland up close, answer questions in an interactive Q&A, and offer up resources for further research with maps and geography.

This event will be broadcast over the LMEC's Facebook Live and YouTube Live channels.
