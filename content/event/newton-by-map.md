Using [Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/), the Leventhal Map & Education Center’s user-friendly portal for exploring urban atlases, we’ll dive into the historical geography of Newton. Come learn about how the community has changed over time, and discover how to research the history of your own house and neighborhood.
