##### **The world and the places we inhabit are forever changing...**

Every place goes through changes, even the cities, countries, and empires we think will be around until the end of time. Sometimes environmental shifts or disasters bring about a catastrophic collapse. Other times human whims and desires lead to the decimation of historic areas, irreversibly altering the very fabric of the region.

Through the maps on display in this *From The Vault*, we can revisit these places of the past. From the historic counterparts of modern day cities or the ancient ruins of a fallen society, *Changed/Forgotten* will show us just how much has changed, how much has been forgotten, and yet how much still remains from a time gone by.

This free showing will be hosted Friday, May 16 in the Leventhal Map & Education Center with a staff member available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing.

Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
