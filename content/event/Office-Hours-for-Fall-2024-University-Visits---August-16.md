Are you a university teacher who would like to bring geographic inquiry into your classroom—or bring your classroom to the Leventhal Center—in the 2024–2025 academic year? Join us for a drop-in session where our curatorial and education team will answer questions about how we support teaching and learning at the university level.

Curricular areas which are particularly well suited for collaborative learning with the Leventhal Center include:

* historical geography and environmental history
* urban history and urban studies
* history of science and technology
* American studies
* local and regional history of Boston and New England
* GIS and geospatial methods
* critical cartography
* digital humanities
* media studies

No pre-registration is required, and you can join the session using [this Zoom link](https://zoom.us/j/92213793386?pwd=uAnn0wSLnwSnyNxCqie38HmLofipNH.1).
