Looking to add more maps to your life? Join us for an afternoon of close map looking! For this edition of *From The Vault*, we'll take a look at objects from our collections that map national parks, green space around Boston and beyond.

*Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM.*

##### *From The Vault*

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions **do not** include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
