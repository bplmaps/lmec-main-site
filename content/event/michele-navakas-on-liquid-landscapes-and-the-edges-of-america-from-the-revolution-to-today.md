title = "Michele Navakas on Liquid Landscapes and the Edges of America, From the Revolution to Today"

+++
##### A scholar of early America's watery landscapes takes us to the edges of the American Revolutionary Era, with lessons about people and place that resonate today

#### This talk is the first in the Richard H. Brown Seminar on the Historical Geography of the American Revolutionary Era

Join scholar Michelle Navakas as she explores the "liquid landscapes" of places like Florida in the eighteenth century, helping us reframe our understanding of the American Revolutionary period through cartography, landscape history. Navakas examines a rich archive of historical documents that show how diverse groups of people met, struggled, and mixed in regions where boundaries themselves were hard to define.
