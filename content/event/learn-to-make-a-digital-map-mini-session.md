### **_Small Bites: Learn to Make a Digital Map Mini-session_**

For the 2021-22 school year the Map Center is offering a series of FREE “small bites” professional development sessions foregrounding teaching about Boston through a social justice lens, though the sessions are easily adaptable to other municipalities. These 6 sessions will run after school and will be a mix of in-person and Zoom sessions designed to send you off with great map-based lessons and resources to immediately implement in your classroom. All K-12 teachers are welcome. Sign up for one or all of them!

Do you want to help students explore social issues through mapping? We’ll introduce you to some basics of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and show you how to create a lesson where students can map two layers of geospatial information about Boston such as race and ethnicity data.
