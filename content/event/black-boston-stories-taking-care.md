Apolo Cátala works with the Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation where he is the Farm Manager of the NDC's OASIS On Ballou Avenue Urban Farm in Dorchester as well as the NDC's Interim Environmental Justice Coordinator. He is an alum of Food Solutions New England Network Leadership Institute, Urban Farming Institute and Trustees of Reservation Master Gardener training programs and a recipient of the Urban Farming Institute 2019 Community Cultivator Award. Apolo serves on the boards Boston Farms Community Land Trust, Tufts University Medical Center IRB as well as Stakeholder Panel Member of Tufts University CTSI, and Boston Public Health Commission Health Equity Advisor Board (2020-2021), and is also active with Boston Food Access Council, UFI, FSNE, and Dorchester Food Coop through which he champions local farming and sourcing as a means of promoting individual, community, and environmental health and equity across the urban, peri-urban, rural, regional and beyond food system continuum. 

**Reggie Jean**, [Haley House](https://haleyhouse.org/). Reggie Jean, a Boston native, most recently was the executive director of the YMCA of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. He is also the co-founder and president of IWC Boston which assists individuals in financial literacy and education on wealth building. He holds a degree in economics from UMass-Amherst.

**Jo-Anna Rorie**, [Neighborhood Birth Center](https://neighborhoodbirthcenter.org/). Dr. Jo-Anna Rorie (she/her) has an extensive background in nurse-midwifery, public health, diversity workforce development, social justice advocacy and has held many well-known leadership roles in midwifery at the local, regional and national levels. She began her career in the late 1980’s when Massachusetts was faced with an infant mortality crisis, especially in the Boston neighborhoods of North Dorchester, Mattapan and Roxbury. She was the featured midwife in a provocative and pivotal Boston Globe series that highlighted the “Death Zones of Boston” – and brought the devastating statistics about racial and ethnic disparities within Boston’s infant mortality crisis into the light of day. Jo-Anna called for a “Marshall Plan” to address the deeply rooted and vexing problems underpinning the high infant mortality rates. Taken together, these events both inspired and motivated the development and implementation of the Boston University Nurse-Midwifery Education Program (NMEP) in 1993 where she served as Associate Director. She continues to do clinical practice as a postpartum rounder for the Nurse Midwifery practice at Boston Medical Center.

Organized as part of the Leventhal Map & Education Center’s ongoing exhibition, *[Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases](https://www.leventhalmap.org/about/press-releases/new-exhibition-building-blocks-boston-stories-from-urban-atlases-opens-at-leventhal-map-education-center-january-13-2023-1/)*.
