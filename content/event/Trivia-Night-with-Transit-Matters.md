Join the **[Leventhal Map and Education Center](https://www.leventhalmap.org/)** with **[TransitMatters](https://transitmatters.org/)** for a trivia night about Boston Transit

Trivia rounds will focus on the theme of transit equity where knowledge about the city’s rails, routes, streets, stations, and more will prove highly useful!

Registration is encouraged but not required. You may participate individually or as a member of a team. This event will be held in person in the Newsfeed Café at the [Central Library](https://www.bpl.org/locations/3/) in Copley Square.

Prizes of maps will be awarded to winning teams!

**[TransitMatters](https://transitmatters.org/)** is a Massachusetts-based non-profit organization that fights for better public transportation through data-driven and people-focused advocacy.

***Transit Equity Month*** began as Transit Equity Day, held on February 4th to honor Rosa Parks' birthday and her legacy. The celebration has recently been extended to the full month of February to capture the array of issues that affect transit equity, including environmental justice, labor rights, racial equity, and more to support better transportation for all.
