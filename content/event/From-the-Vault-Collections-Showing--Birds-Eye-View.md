### About this event

Join us for this From The Vault as we take to the skies with a collection of “bird’s eye view” maps! Panoramic maps, also known as bird’s eye view maps, were a popular cartographic form used primarily by U.S. cities and towns during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Although not generally drawn to scale like a more “traditional” map, they show street patterns, individual buildings, and major landscape features from a raised perspective - resembling what a bird might see if it was flying over the area.

This free showing will be hosted Friday, March 15 in the Learning Center with a staff member from the Leventhal Center available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

#### From The Vault

The Leventhal Map and Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, From The Vault, attempts to remedy that limitation. From The Vault is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
