> ***It's not uncommon to be proud of the place you live... but these maps take it to another level!***

After the industrial boom of the mid-to-late 1800s, Americans suddenly had access to leisure time, extra spending money, numerous transportation options and they were ready to explore the vast country around around them. This period also marked a time of immigration 

In this *From The Vault*, we dive into some of the longest and tallest maps in the LMEC archives, all of which are at least 3 times as wide as they are tall (or vice versa). From rivers to railroads, from green parks to gold rushes, these maps document how cartographers have fixated on long landscapes—including one 12-foot long map of the Boston Marathon, printed on a receipt!

This free showing will be hosted Friday, September 5 in the Leventhal Map & Education Center with a staff member available to answer questions. 

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map & Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
