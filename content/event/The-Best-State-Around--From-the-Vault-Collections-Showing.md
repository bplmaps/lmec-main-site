> ***It's not uncommon to be proud of the place you live... but these maps take it to another level!***

In this *From The Vault*, we'll take a look at some promotional state maps from the 1890s to 1930s. Some maps use comedy to poke fun at the rest of the country, while others espouse the successes and deep history of their land to capture a potential visitor's attention. Each state does things a little differently and we invite visitors to answer the question: *"What truly is the best state around?"*

This free showing will be hosted Friday, September 5 in the Leventhal Map & Education Center with a staff member available to answer questions.

Drop in any time between 2:00PM - 4:00PM. No reservation is required.

##### ***From The Vault***

The Leventhal Map & Education Center cares for more than a quarter million cartographic and geographic objects, including maps, atlases, charts, globes, gazetteers, ephemera, research texts, and data sets. With such an extensive collection, it is likely that many of these objects will never be included in exhibitions for public viewing. Our latest series, *From The Vault*, attempts to remedy that limitation. *From The Vault* is a biweekly, casual collections showing of objects selected by Leventhal Center staff. These drop-in sessions do not include a formal presentation, though Leventhal Center staff will be available to interpret objects, chat, and answer questions.
