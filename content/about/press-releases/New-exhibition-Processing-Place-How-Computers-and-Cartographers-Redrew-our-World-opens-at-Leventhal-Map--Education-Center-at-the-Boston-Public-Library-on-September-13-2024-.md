**BOSTON, MA – August 17, 2024** - *Processing Place: How Computers and Cartographers Redrew our World*, a free public exhibition at the Leventhal Map & Education Center (LMEC) at the Boston Public Library (BPL), will open this fall on September 13, 2024. 

Taking a historical approach to the now familiar world of digital mapping, *Processing Place* explores how new computer technologies developed during the twentieth century drove profound changes in environmental management, law and policy, navigation, national defense, and much more. By comparing maps made with computers to those made before and without them, *Processing Place* invites us to rethink the relationships between maps, technology, and society. *Processing Place* is curated by Leventhal Center staff members Ian Spangler, Assistant Curator of Digital & Participatory Geography, and Emily Bowe, Assistant Director. 

Centered on how computer maps came to dominate our geographic imagination in the present, *Processing Place* will explore how companies, inventors, and public agencies created the computer mapping systems we now take for granted. The exhibition emphasizes the human role in digital mapmaking, highlighting how people have used computer technologies to encode observations about the world and make arguments through data and information. Visitors to the exhibition will come away seeing the maps on their phones and computer screens in a new light, as the result of decades of innovations and thousands of choices by technologists, designers, and cartographers. 

The exhibit will feature maps and other objects from the Leventhal Center’s unique collections of the history of computer cartography and digital mapping. In recent years, the Leventhal Center has become one of the leading collecting institutions dedicated to expanding the archive of twentieth century computer cartography and geographic information systems (GIS). As visitors explore early cartographic technologies, innovative uses of digital community mapping projects, and centuries-old data visualizations in *Processing Place*, they will learn how handcraft and human creativity are just as essential to computer-drawn maps as they are to maps on parchment from centuries before. 

Maps are just one of the most prominent examples of how computers have radically transformed our experience of space and place. As our society confronts more challenges about what it means to live in a world mediated by digital technologies—from AI to social media—*Processing Place* offers a visually rich and historically informed public conversation about how technology, society, information, and computation came together to "redraw our world."

The Leventhal Map & Education Center offers multiple ways for K-12 students and educators to engage with exhibitions, collections, and critical conversations using maps. Education programs at the Leventhal Center use guided inquiry to explore maps from the collections to encourage students to investigate their relationships to places in the past and present. A guided educational tour of *Processing Place* will encourage students to reflect on their place in the world and how maps capture and represent their lived experiences.
