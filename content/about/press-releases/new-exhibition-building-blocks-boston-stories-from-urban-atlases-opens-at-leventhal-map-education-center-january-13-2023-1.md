**BOSTON — December 9, 2022 —** A new exhibition that brings to the life the street-scale changes of Boston a century ago opens January 13 at the Leventhal Map & Education Center (LMEC) at the Boston Public Library (BPL). _Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases_ features rare materials from the BPL’s historic collection of maps and atlases alongside lithographs, photographs, and sketches of familiar local landscapes. Visitors will discover how the atlas collections opens up a world of fascinating stories, with vignettes including the country’s first African Meeting House in the heart of Beacon Hill, landmarks of leisure like the “Derby Racer” and “Giant Safety Thriller” amusement rides in Revere, public health infrastructure on Gallops Island in the former South Bay, and many more.

_Building Blocks_ is open from January 13 through August 19, 2023 and, like all exhibitions at the Leventhal Center, it is free to the public at the Central Library in Copley Square.

“The world got a bit bigger and more connected at the turn of the twentieth century, and not unlike our own time, the cityscape reflected tremendous social transformations. I think we need to see multiple layers to keep pace with all the change,” says Exhibition Curatorial Fellow **Laura Lee Schmidt**. “The urban atlases shown in this exhibition act like a flip book for urban metamorphosis—we can look through successive views of the same parcel of land over time. _Building Blocks_ aims to explore the potentials for telling stories of a dynamic period. It’s surprising what can come to life in maps.”

Among the exhibition highlights:

* A building-by-building look at the transforming city skyline, featuring Boston's first skyscraper at 1 Court Street and the rising height of the Custom House Tower in Boston's Financial District. \[[Image 1](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth-oai:h415rv54v); [Image 2](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:2801pj41r)\]
* A collection of local histories uncovered and reconstructed by a team of teen curators from Boston Public Schools, including the origins of Ronan Park in Dorchester, Kelleher Rose Garden in Back Bay Fens, and the once-bustling cattle industry of Brighton. \[[Image 1](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1257bz472); [Image 2](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1257c3871); [Image 3](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:0c4862940)\]
* An interwoven, biographic account of Florida Ruffin Ridley, a young, Black Bostonian teacher, activist and writer who worked, studied, played, and created within the landscapes on display. \[[Image](https://bostonpubliclibrary.sharepoint.com/sites/LeventhalMap/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FLeventhalMap%2FShared%20Documents%2FEducation%2FK%2D12%2FExhibitions%2FBuilding%20Blocks%2FFlorida%2FImages%20for%20design%2FCC%5Fconvention%2Ejpeg&parent=%2Fsites%2FLeventhalMap%2FShared%20Documents%2FEducation%2FK%2D12%2FExhibitions%2FBuilding%20Blocks%2FFlorida%2FImages%20for%20design&p=true&ga=1)\]

Beyond the stories narrated in this exhibition, the rich details of the atlases hint at thousands, or even millions, of others. Because the Leventhal Center’s atlas collection includes fine-grained detail down to the individual shapes of buildings and owners of property, _Building Blocks_ invites visitors to discover their own stories in the maps.

#### A Digital Exhibition with the Power of Atlascope

For those who can’t visit the in-person exhibition at the Boston Public Library, an extensive companion digital exhibition will feature the collections and interpretive stories from the exhibition in a rich interactive format. The online exhibition will feature a self-guided tour of the themes and objects in the live show, links to related essays and resources, zoomable views of ultra-high-resolution historic objects, and lesson plans and classroom items for teachers.

_Building Blocks_ utilizes the same collection of atlases that are accessible in the Leventhal Center’s widely-used digital tool Atlascope™, available for free public use at [atlascope.leventhalmap.org](http://atlascope.leventhalmap.org). Atlascope offers the ability to overlay more than 100 urban atlases directly over a modern web map, and makes it easy to flip through layers of historical change from a desktop or mobile device. With the opening of _Building Block_s in the Leventhal Center’s exhibition gallery, the Center will also release a new, upgraded version of the Atlascope tool, with new features to empower storytelling, annotation, and discovery, as well as connections into other Massachusetts digital collections. Atlascope and the _Building Blocks_ digital exhibition together form a suite of digital tools that will make Boston one of the extraordinary sites in the United States to conduct fine-scale historical map investigations in a manner that is widely accessible to both specialists and non-specialists alike.

“The Leventhal Center is a leader in developing digital tools that put geography and history together in fascinating new ways,” says **Garrett Dash Nelson,** President & Head Curator. “_Building Blocks_ opens the question of what we might see in the history of familiar spaces when we look carefully at these detailed urban atlases. Atlascope then empowers citizens to go answer those questions for themselves.”

#### Education and Public Access

_Building Blocks_ will feature a variety of ways for young people, educators, and families to explore everyday life in Boston a century ago. Window nooks geared to young people will feature activities such as a matching game identifying the shapes of locations in the atlases (such as the vanished South End baseball grounds) with photos of those same places. Young people and families can also follow the story of Florida Ruffin Ridley and her life as a young, Black Bostonian teacher, activist and writer at the turn of the 20th century. Ridley’s story connects with many of the larger themes in the exhibition and highlights many locations of importance to Boston’s Black community at that time.

#### Community Events

Public events and outreach programs during the run of _Building Blocks_ will include curatorial talks, local history deep dives, and hands-on workshops, both at the Central Library, online, and in other in-person venues. More details on exhibition-related activities will be announced later this spring at [leventhalmap.org/event](http://leventhalmap.org/event).

#### Hours and Exhibition Details

_Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases_ is open **Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from 11 am-5 pm, Wednesdays from 1-7 pm, and Sundays from 1-5pm. Admission is free.** Guided tours are available at all times by request.
