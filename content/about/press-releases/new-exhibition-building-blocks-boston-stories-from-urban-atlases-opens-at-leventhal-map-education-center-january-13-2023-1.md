**BOSTON — December 9, 2022 —** A new exhibition that illuminates small scale stories of urban change opens this month at the Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library (BPL). _Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases_ includes rare materials from the BPL’s historic collection of geographic objects alongside lithographs, photographs, and sketches of familiar Boston landscapes. Visitors will find objects that range from nineteenth-century urban atlases by Somerville-born Daniel Sanborn, to early postcards of Revere Beach and photographs of the Tremont Street Cyclorama. _Building Blocks_ runs January 13 through August 19, 2023 and, like all exhibitions at the Leventhal Center, it is free to the public at the BPL Central Library in Copley Square.

“The world got a bit bigger and more connected at the turn of the twentieth century, and not unlike our own time, the cityscape reflected tremendous social transformations. I think we need to see multiple layers to keep pace with all the change,” says Exhibition Curatorial Fellow **Laura Lee Schmidt**. “The urban atlases shown in this show act like a flip book for urban metamorphosis—we can look through successive views of the same parcel of land over time. _Building Blocks_ aims to explore the potentials for telling stories of a dynamic period. It’s surprising what can come to life in maps.”

Among the exhibition highlights:

* An encompassing look at the transforming city skyline, featuring Boston's first skyscraper at 1 Court Street and the upward-growing Custom House Tower in Boston's Financial District.  \[[Image 1](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth-oai:h415rv54v); [Image 2](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:2801pj41r)\]
* A collection of local histories uncovered and reconstructed by a team of teen curators, including the origins of Ronan Park in Dorchester, Kelleher Rose Garden in Back Bay Fens, and the once-bustling cattle industry of Brighton. \[[Image 1](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1257bz472); [Image 2](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:1257c3871); [Image 3](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:0c4862940)\]
* An interwoven, biographic account of Florida Ruffin Ridley, a young, Black Bostonian teacher, activist and writer who worked, studied, played, and created within the landscapes on display. \[[Image](https://bostonpubliclibrary.sharepoint.com/sites/LeventhalMap/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FLeventhalMap%2FShared%20Documents%2FEducation%2FK%2D12%2FExhibitions%2FBuilding%20Blocks%2FFlorida%2FImages%20for%20design%2FCC%5Fconvention%2Ejpeg&parent=%2Fsites%2FLeventhalMap%2FShared%20Documents%2FEducation%2FK%2D12%2FExhibitions%2FBuilding%20Blocks%2FFlorida%2FImages%20for%20design&p=true&ga=1)\]

Beyond the stories narrated in this exhibition, the rich details of the atlases hint at thousands, or even millions, of others. From the perspective of these pages, perhaps it’s not so difficult to imagine one’s own story in a rapidly developing city during a moment steeped in change.

#### A Digital and Physical Exhibition

For those who can’t visit the exhibition at the Boston Public Library, the Leventhal Map and Education Center will create a digital exhibition that offers a chance to experience _Building Blocks_ from anywhere. The online exhibition will feature a self-guided tour of the themes and objects in the live show, links to related essays and resources, zoomable views of ultra-high-resolution historic objects, and lesson plans and classroom items for teachers.

#### Education and Public Access

_Building Blocks_ will feature a variety of ways for young people, educators and families to explore how Boston developed over time. Window nooks geared to young people will feature activities such as a matching game identifying the shapes of places in the atlases (such as the long-gone South End baseball grounds) with photos of those places. Young people and families can also follow the story of Florida Ruffin Ridley and her life as a young, Black Bostonian teacher, activist and writer at the turn of the 20th century. Ridley’s story connects with many of the larger themes in the exhibition and highlights many locations and work of Boston’s Black community at that time.

#### Community Events

Public events and outreach programs during the run of _Building Blocks_ will include curatorial talks, local history deep dives, and hands-on workshops. More details on this and all exhibition-related activities will be announced later this spring.

#### Hours and Exhibition Details

_Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases_ is open Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays from 11 am-5 pm, Wednesdays from 1-7 pm, and Sundays from 1-5pm. Admission is free.
