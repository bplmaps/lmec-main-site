### Free exhibition at the Boston Public Library Central Branch explores how maps have been used as propaganda, advertising, and arguments

### From early 16<sup>th</sup> century maps to modern data visualizations, the show arrives in-person after award-winning debut as a digital presentation

**BOSTON — August 24, 2021 —** The Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library reopens next month with “Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception,” an exhibition that takes a critical look at whether seeing is believing in the worlds of cartography and digital data. Drawn from the award-winning online exhibition that was redesigned as a digital-first experience after COVID shut down plans for a May 2020 opening, the in-person show features a stunning array of original maps and documents, some dating back more than five centuries.

Curated by the Leventhal Map and Education Center’s President and Head Curator Garrett Dash Nelson, “Bending Lines” opens to the public on Friday, September 10, 2021. Information about the in-person show and access to the digital exhibition is available at [leventhalmap.org](https://www.leventhalmap.org/).

#### Exhibition overview

From a 16<sup>th</sup>-century Ptolemaic map (highlight, l.) that highlights the struggle to fit the New World into classical geography, to an infamous 2019 “Sharpie-enhanced” weather map meant to spin the politics of disaster planning, the pieces on display in “Bending Lines” show how maps can be used to persuade. By reorienting the perspective on maps from a simple question of true and false to a more complicated question of motives and values, “Bending Lines” scrutinizes how people’s choices are always part of the mapmaking process. 

The exhibition shows that attempts to shape public opinion aren’t limited to election years, wartime, or advertising billboards. The wide range of objects and topics in “Bending Lines” challenges viewers to consider the social, cultural and political environments in which maps and data are created and deployed.

In addition to rare historic materials, _Bending Lines_ includes pioneering examples of data visualization, and contemporary holdings from the BPL’s extensive map collection, which the Leventhal Map and Education Center manages. Significant documents from Massachusetts history are displayed alongside national and world treasures, and in contrast to ephemeral examples of maps in advertising and media. Interactive displays show visitors the power of persuasive mapmaking and demonstrate how subjectivity is inherent even in “objective” data. 

Among the object highlights on display:

* A 1507 map showing that European mapmakers struggled to negotiate differences between then-new discoveries and the authority of ancient geography;
* A “new and accurate map of the world” from 1626 that promotes a geocentric view of the solar system and portrays California as an island – it is one of the first world maps to show European settlement in New England;
* An 1820s broadside mocking Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry, whose politically motivated redrawing of his Essex County senate district in 1812 spurred political rivals to coin the enduring term “Gerry-mander”;
* World War II propaganda news maps made by the U.S. government to stir up a sense of global emergency and patriotism;
* A groundbreaking “flow map” by 19<sup>th</sup> century French cartographer Charles Joseph Minard;
* A selection of wartime maps including a relic from the Russo-Turkish War showing Russia as an octopus
* A pair of historic maps promoting strikingly different political views of New York City – one from a socialist perspective and the other from a right-wing, anti-communist group; and
* A dizzying bird’s-eye perspective on Boston, designed to sell a local soda company’s wares.

_“Bending Lines_ focuses on the motivations and decisions of cartographers and designers about what to show and what not to show,” Nelson says. “Every choice about representing the world through symbols and images shapes a viewer's perception.” Maps have myriad social purposes, he says: some aim to encourage land speculation or nationalism; others act as tourist boosters; still others sell products and ideas or bolster electoral campaigns. But Nelson emphasizes map-making needn’t be a discipline that comes down from on high.

“We’re showing how these types of visual rhetoric are tools not only for the powerful, but also those who challenge them,” Nelson says. “_Bending Lines_ sheds light on the complicated conversation about who gets to decide what we believe, and how seeing is not always believing.”

#### Education resources

As with all Leventhal Map Center exhibitions, _Bending Lines_ features resources that  support a rich experience for educators, students, and families. A custom tour designed for young learners takes students through some of the most important critical questions to ask when evaluating the reliability of a map. These tours are available both as online follow-along guides as well as captions and stops in the gallery meant for young learners. In-gallery activities and kid-friendly captions encourage younger visitors to think about how manipulation becomes an inevitable part of the mapmaking process.
