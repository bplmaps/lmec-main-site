### Library Exhibition of Chinese Maps Takes a Close Look at Cosmography and Color 

##### New exhibition “Heaven & Earth: The Blue Maps of China” opens at Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library on May 11, 2024

**Boston, MA - April 16, 2024** - *Heaven & Earth: The Blue Maps of China*, a free public exhibition at the Leventhal Map & Education Center (LMEC) at the Boston Public Library (BPL) will open this spring on May 11, 2024. 

The exhibition revolves around two extraordinary large-format maps printed in China in the early nineteenth century—one portraying the terrestrial world of the Qing empire and the other portraying a star chart of the heavens. Never before exhibited together, these maps tell a remarkable story of artistic production and political history. They are also some of the very earliest printed materials from East Asia to use the pigment Prussian blue, predating more famous uses of this colorant, such as Hokusai’s *The Great Wave off Kanagawa*, by several decades.

*Heaven & Earth: The Blue Maps of China* is guest curated by Dr. Richard Pegg, Director and Curator of the MacLean Collection in Illinois. The exhibition pairs the MacLean Collection’s copy of the blue terrestrial map with maps from the Leventhal Center, Harvard-Yenching Library, Harvard Map Collection, and Adler Planetarium. 

“My first encounter with these maps I think would be similar to anyone’s: *Wow!* These are impressive and beautiful objects. Trained as an art historian, I wanted to understand what I was looking at and how they were made,” says Dr. Pegg. “Visually, when placed side by side, these two maps remind the viewer of the relationship between humankind, heaven, and earth. These are depictions of heaven and earth through the lens of human perception with the intention of human interpretation and use.” 

One of the goals of this exhibition is to encourage visitors to consider the juxtaposition of East Asian concepts of geography and cosmography with those of Europeans at the same time. Visitors will learn how these maps were used as tools of political administration for Qing rulers, while also serving as unique objects of artistic production. 

“The maps in *Heaven & Earth* draw you in on multiple levels,” says Garrett Dash Nelson, President & Head Curator at the Leventhal Center. “They are striking and engrossing visual objects, rendered on a colossal scale. At the same time, they are invitations to contemplate how people in a very different historic and geographic context understood the world around them.” 

*Heaven & Earth* also features the work of teen curators from Boston Public Schools who worked with the Center’s K-12 education team. Students learned about the maps in the exhibition and responded to the “blue maps” with artwork of their own, reflecting on the artists’ ideas about how individuals fit into a larger cosmology.
