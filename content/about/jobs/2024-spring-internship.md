The Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library seeks to hire a cohort of undergraduate interns across all of the Center's project areas, with the goal of training the next generation of professionals in topics including geospatial technology, public humanities, and nonprofit management.

Interns will work onsite in the Center's offices at the Central Library for 6-10 hours per week from mid-January 2024 through mid-May 2024. Each intern will be part of an operational track focusing on either **Geohumanities & GIS** or **Development & Fundraising**. Additionally, all interns will be expected to cover at least one four-hour shift welcoming visitors at the front desk of our public gallery at the Central Library as part of their role.

This is a part-time, hourly, fixed-term position and individuals will only be eligible to serve as interns for one semester during their time as an undergraduate. If you've never worked in a museum or library, that's fine! We're looking for curious minds with the desire to learn. We prefer enthusiasm over depth of skill.

This opportunity may be particularly suitable for the following types of undergraduate students:

* Students studying history, urban studies, geography, environmental studies, or museum/library studies
* Students with interest in learning more about maps & geography, nonprofit management, K-12 education, museum studies, fundraising & communications, digital humanities & library collections

### Internship Tracks

##### Geohumanities & GIS

Geohumanities & GIS interns will learn how to use different kinds of geospatial software and theory to georeference historic atlases from towns around the state of Massachusetts. With support from the Assistant Curator for Digital & Participatory Geography, Geohumanities & GIS interns will also conduct independent research into these atlases with the goal of creating interpretive educational stories for publication on the LMEC website.

##### Development & Fundraising

The development and fundraising intern will work with LMEC Development Coordinator to support both ongoing donor engagement and new, strategic grant-focused projects that will fund future LMEC research and work. Building development skills can be useful for a wide variety of career fields, including the museum and library world, non-profit organizations, and art & humanities/community-focused entities. The student chosen for the role will use their strong research and writing skills to help find grant prospects, craft regular communications to donors and patrons, and conduct direct outreach to potential organizational partners.
