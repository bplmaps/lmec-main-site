#### About this role

The Leventhal Center, an independent research and education institution
housed within the Boston Public Library, is a national leader on
educational topics related to historical geography. In recent years, the
Center has advanced particular focus areas in place-based education,
active learning in primary source collections, civic data literacy, and
the digital geohumanities. The Center's existing programs and
partnerships focus on Boston and the New England region, but include
curricular and resource development work that reaches national and
international audiences. Existing partnerships with the Boston Public
Library and Boston Public Schools offer further opportunities for
growth. The Center seeks a Director of Education who is excited to build
additional institutional partnerships that connect students, educators,
and members of the public in a shared enterprise of civically-engaged
study regarding the past, present, and future of people and places as
seen through the lens of maps and geography.

The new Director of Education & Educational Programs will enjoy the
opportunity to continue building out the Center's existing portfolio of
teaching programs, curricular materials, and teacher professional
development workshops, while also working to integrate these activities
with educational programs beyond the classroom, including the creation
of new digital platforms, high school to college pathways, and public
history/public humanities initiatives. The new Director will also hold
the responsibility for evaluating and expanding the Center's existing
suite of public programs for adult learners. They will also take on a
crucial visioning role as the Center works with the BPL broadly to
identify opportunities to advance teaching and learning at the Central
Library and throughout the branch libraries. While the Director of
Education & Educational Programs is not primarily responsible for
overseeing the Center's exhibitions, collections, curatorial, and
research programs, they will work closely with staff on such programs to
ensure that educational goals play a central role in shaping all of the
Center's activities.

The Director will begin supervising an existing staff member, the K-12
Education Lead, immediately upon hire, and will have the opportunity to
hire 1--2 new staff members in the Education Department (with the input
of other senior staff and pending budgetary approval) within 6--12
months of their start date. The Director's work will also be supported
by curatorial, library, and administrative staff across the Center.
