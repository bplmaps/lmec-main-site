The Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library seeks
to hire an **Exhibition Curatorial Fellow** for the period July 2022
through January 2023, extensible through June 2023. The Curatorial
Fellow will take a lead role in planning, researching, and producing
content for the Center's 2023 exhibition on local-scale history in
Greater Boston. The Curatorial Fellow will have lead authorial and
creative direction over this exhibition, working closely with the Head
Curator and other Center staff, and will be given byline-level credit
for the final installed exhibition. This is a part-time, hourly,
fixed-term position.

This opportunity may be particularly suitable for the following types of
applicants:

* Currently enrolled graduate students in programs such as history, urban studies, museum and library studies, or geography
* Early career research and museum professionals working on local history and urban change
* Individuals engaged with Boston's local history in any capacity, including public historians and community historians

We are particularly interested in applicants who can demonstrate an
interest and skill at connecting themes from historical geographic
research to public engagement around contemporary social issues.

The Center's 2023 exhibition, provisionally titled *Building Up: Stories
from the Atlas Collections,* will draw on the Center's collection of
fire insurance and real estate atlases to tell the story of small-scale
local change from the late nineteenth century onwards. These collections
are the same ones that appear in the Center's
[Atlascope](https://atlascope.org) digital discovery tool.
*Building Up* will feature both historical atlases and original
materials on display in the Center's gallery at the Central Library in
Copley Square, as well as potential moving installations to be shown at
branch libraries and community centers.

**Responsibilities**

The primary role of the Exhibition Curatorial Fellow will involve the
selection of objects, research on local history connected to the
collections material, and the writing of captions and other original
content for the exhibition. The fellow will work closely with Center
staff in this process, and will also work with a cohort of high school
guest curators in Summer 2022 to develop student-generated materials for
the exhibition. The Center will provide research assistance and
supervisory guidance pertaining to the consideration of materials for
physical display, but the Exhibition Curatorial Fellow is expected to
take authorial control over the exhibition's overall narrative and
focus. The scope of the exhibition will consist of approximately 16-20
objects on display, together with associated interpretive panels that
extend the exhibition's storytelling themes with additional material.
The Curatorial Fellow will not be expected to perform design,
fabrication, or install work, but during the final three months of the
exhibition preparation period (October-December 2022), the Fellow will
also take a key role coordinating these activities with close
cooperation from Center staff.

Because the atlas collection primarily covers a chronological period
roughly 1860-1940, we are particularly interested in applicants who can
connect histories of this period to the present, especially on themes
related to community development, architectural and landscape history,
urban and environmental change, social history, and the importance of
historical study for contemporary social justice issues. The Exhibition
Curatorial Fellow will also have an opportunity to work with Center
staff in expanding digital exhibition tools growing out of the existing
Atlascope platform.

This position may be extensible January-June 2023 during the
exhibition's run time, with a role focused on interpreting the
exhibition and coordinating public programs.

**Compensation**

Hours: 0.4 FTE, 16 hours/week

Compensation: \$25.15/hour

This position is not eligible for health benefits.

The Leventhal Center is independent of the Boston Public Library and
does not have a residency requirement for employees. All Leventhal
Center employees are required to present proof of full vaccination
against the COVID-19 virus per federal CDC guidelines.

Work is performed in-person at the Central Library in Copley Square,
though some opportunities for remote work during the research and
writing phase of work will be possible. The Library is well-served by
public transit. No free facilities for employee parking are available.
