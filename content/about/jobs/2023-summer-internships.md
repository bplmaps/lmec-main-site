The Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library seeks to hire two undergraduate interns working on geospatial research, with the goal of training the next generation of professionals in topics including geospatial technology, public humanities, and nonprofit management. Interns will work onsite in the Center's offices at the Central Library for 12-16 hours per week from late May 2023 through mid-August 2023. 

Geospatial research interns will work with the Assistant Curator for Digital & Participatory Geography and gain basic GIS (geographic information system) skills as they geotransform historic atlases from towns around the state of Massachusetts. Interns will also work on other smaller digital projects (web maps, data visualizations) to support interpretive and educational work. Additionally, each week both interns will be expected to cover at least two four-hour shifts welcoming visitors at the front desk of our public gallery at the Central Library as part of their role. It is likely that one of the gallery shifts will occur during our weekend gallery hours. 

This is a part-time, hourly, fixed-term position and individuals will only be eligible to serve as interns for one summer during their time as an undergraduate. If you've never worked in a museum or library, that's fine! We're looking for curious minds with the desire to learn. We prefer enthusiasm over depth of skill.

This opportunity may be particularly suitable for the following types of undergraduate students:

* Students studying history, urban studies, geography, environmental studies, or museum/library studies
* Students with interest in learning more about maps & geography, museum studies, digital humanities & library collections

* This position is not eligible for health benefits.
