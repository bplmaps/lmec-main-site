{{\</ alert-box >}}

The Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library seeks to hire a cohort of undergraduate interns across all of the Center's project areas, with the goal of training the next generation of professionals in topics including geospatial technology, public humanities, and nonprofit management. Interns will work onsite in the Center's offices at the Central Library for 6-10 hours per week from early September 2023 through mid-December 2023. Each intern will be part of an operational track focusing on **geospatial research** or **development & fundraising**. As part of this role, all interns will be expected to work in the LMEC offices for a 3-4 hour shift on Wednesdays or Fridays and to cover at least one four-hour weekend shift welcoming visitors at the front desk of our public gallery at the Central Library. This is a part-time, hourly, fixed-term position and individuals will only be eligible to serve as interns for one semester during their time as an undergraduate. If you've never worked in a museum or library, that's fine! We're looking for curious minds with the desire to learn. We prefer enthusiasm over depth of skill.

This opportunity may be particularly suitable for the following types of undergraduate students:

* Students studying history, urban studies, geography, environmental studies, or museum/library studies
* Students with interest in learning more about maps & geography, nonprofit management, K-12 education, museum studies, fundraising & communications, digital humanities & library collections

### Internship Tracks

##### Geospatial Research

In collaboration with the Assistant Curator for Digital & Participatory Geography, geospatial research interns will gain basic GIS (geographic information system) skills as they work with historic atlases from towns around the state of Massachusetts. Interns will also work on other smaller digital projects (web maps, data visualizations) to support interpretive and educational work.

##### Development & Fundraising

The development and fundraising intern will work with LMEC Development Coordinator to support both ongoing donor engagement and new, strategic projects that will fund future LMEC research and work. Building development skills can be useful for a wide variety of career fields, including the museum and library world, non-profit organizations, and art & humanities/community-focused entities. The student chosen for the role will use their strong research and writing skills to help with grant prospects and proposals, craft regular communications to donors and patrons, and conduct direct outreach to potential organizational partners.
