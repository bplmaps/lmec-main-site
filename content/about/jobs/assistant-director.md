The **Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library** seeks
to hire for the position of **Assistant Director.** The Assistant Director,
reporting directly to the Center's President & Head Curator, is
responsible for coordinating and managing key aspects of the Center's
administration and operations, while also leading project-based work on
themes connecting cartographic collections and geographic visualization
to present-day issues on topics such as urban studies, community
history, and the digital humanities. Successful candidates will have
both a demonstrated record of organizational skill in managing projects
at varying levels of complexity, as well as a vision for developing
innovative, research-driven content for public audiences that
demonstrates a vital engagement with contemporary issues.

The Assistant Director will supervise staff in the Center's CIRCLE
working group (Collections, Interpretation, Research, Community
Learning, and Exhibitions). Together with the Director of Education, the
Assistant Director will comprise the President & Head Curator's senior
staff. With this senior staff, the Assistant Director leads on budgeting
and personnel issues, and the Assistant Director oversees the direct
administration of budget planning and reporting. The Assistant Director
will facilitate relationships with key staff in the Boston Public
Library, and will speak about the Center's collections, programs, and
activities as a whole in front of a variety of audiences and
constituencies.

The Assistant Director will also work with the President & Head Curator
and Development Coordinator to develop long-term strategies around grant
funding and organizational capacity-building. The ideal candidate will
demonstrate an ability to work across an entire project's lifecycle,
from conceptualization and narrative, to funding and management, direct
engagement with content (in written, visual, computational,
installation, practice, or other formats), and promotional activities.
The Center will also support the Assistant Director in developing their
own portfolio of creative and intellectual outputs.

Excellent planning, organizational, and interpersonal skills are a key
requirement for this position, together with an ability to work flexibly
with a variety of digital tools. The ideal candidate will be a creative
thinker and problem solver: someone who is highly motivated to
continuously improve internal systems and processes in their management
of operations. These same skills should be demonstrated not only for
internal operations but also for project development, execution, and
planning for strategic growth of the Center.
