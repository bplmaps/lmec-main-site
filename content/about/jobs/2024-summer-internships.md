The Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library seeks to hire a cohort of undergraduate interns, with the goal of training the next generation of professionals in topics related to geospatial technology, public humanities, and librarianship.

Interns will work onsite in the Center's offices at the Central Library for 6-10 hours per week from mid-May 2024 through early August 2024.

Interns will be part of an operational track focused on either [Geohumanities & GIS](#geohumanities--gis) or on [Fundraising & Development](#fundraising--development). Additionally, all interns will be expected to cover at least one 3 to 4-hour shift welcoming visitors at the front desk of our public gallery at the Central Library as part of their role.

This is a part-time, hourly, fixed-term position and individuals will only be eligible to serve as interns for one semester during their time as an undergraduate. If you've never worked in a museum or library, that's fine! We're looking for curious minds with the desire to learn. We prefer enthusiasm over depth of skill.

This opportunity may be particularly suitable for the following types of undergraduate students:

* Students studying history, urban studies, geography, environmental studies, or museum/library studies
* Students with interest in learning more about maps & geography, nonprofit management, K-12 education, museum studies, fundraising & communications, digital humanities & library collections

### Geohumanities & GIS

Geohumanities & GIS interns will learn how to use different kinds of geospatial software and theory to [georeference](https://www.leventhalmap.org/projects/digital-projects/georeferencing/) historic atlases from towns around the state of Massachusetts. With support from the Assistant Curator for Digital & Participatory Geography, Geohumanities & GIS interns will also conduct independent research into these atlases with the goal of creating interpretive educational stories and resources for publication on the LMEC website.

### Fundraising & Development

The fundraising & development intern will work with LMEC Development & Grants Manager to support both ongoing donor engagement and new, strategic projects that will fund future LMEC research and work. The student chosen for the role will use their strong research and writing skills to craft regular communications to donors, patrons, or organizational partners, and assist with grant projects.
