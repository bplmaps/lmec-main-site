The Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library seeks to hire a cohort of undergraduate interns across all of the Center's project areas, with the goal of training the next generation of professionals in topics ranging from geospatial technology, public humanities, and nonprofit management. Interns will work onsite in the Center's offices at the Central Library  for 6-10 hours per week from mid-January 2023 through mid-May 2023. Each intern will be part of an operational track focusing on **geospatial research**, **K-12 education**, or **development & fundraising**. Additionally, all interns will be expected to cover at least one four-hour shift welcoming visitors at the front desk of our public gallery at the Central Library as part of their role. This is a part-time, hourly, fixed-term position and individuals will only be eligible to serve as interns for one semester during their time as an undergraduate. If you've never worked in a museum or library, that's fine! We're looking for curious minds with the desire to learn. We prefer enthusiasm over depth of skill.

This opportunity may be particularly suitable for the following types of undergraduate students:

* Students studying history, urban studies, geography, environmental studies, or museum/library studies
* Students with interest in learning more about maps & geography, nonprofit management, K-12 education, museum studies, fundraising & communications, digital humanities & library collections

### Internship Tracks

##### Geospatial Research

Geospatial research interns will work with the Assistant Curator for Digital & Participatory Geography and gain basic GIS (geospatial information system) skills as they work with historic atlases from towns around the state of Massachusetts. Interns will also work on other smaller smaller digital projects (web maps, data visualizations) to support interpretive and educational work.

##### K-12 Education

The K-12 intern will assist K-12 education staff with a project to overhaul existing digital teaching materials available online. This intern will learn more about teaching in a K-12 setting and creating curriculum material that can bring the LMEC collection into classrooms that serve a variety of subjects and ages.

##### Development & Fundraising 

The development and fundraising intern will work with LMEC Development Coordinator to support both ongoing donor engagement and new, strategic grant-focused projects that will fund future LMEC research and work. Building development skills can be useful for a wide variety of career fields, including the museum and library world, non-profit organizations, and art & humanities/community-focused entities. The student chosen for the role will use their strong research and writing skills to help find grant prospects, craft regular communications to donors and patrons, and conduct direct outreach to potential organizational partners.
