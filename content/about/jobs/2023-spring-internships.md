The Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library seeks to hire 4-5 undergraduate interns for 6-10 hours per week from mid-January 2023 through mid-May 2023. Interns will be part of a semester-long cohort of other students from universities in the greater Boston area. Each intern will be part of an operational track focusing on **geospatial research**, **K-12 education**, or **development & fundraising**. Additionally, all interns will be expected to cover up to six (6) hours of time at the front desk of our public gallery at the Central Library as part of their role. This is a part-time, hourly, fixed-term position and individuals will only be eligible to serve as interns for one semester during their time as an undergraduate. If you've never worked in a museum or library, that's fine! We're looking for curious minds with the desire to learn. We prefer enthusiasm over depth of skill.

This opportunity may be particularly suitable for the following types of undergraduate students:

* Students studying history, urban studies, geography, environmental studies, or museum/library studies
* Students with interest in learning more about maps & geography, non-profit management, K-12 education, museum studies, fundraising & communications, digital humanities & library collections

### Internship Tracks

##### Geospatial Research (2-3 positions)

Geospatial research interns will work with the Assistant Curator for Digital & Participatory Geography and gain basic GIS (geospatial information system) skills as they work with historic fire insurance atlases from towns around the state of Massachusetts. Interns will also work on other smaller smaller digital projects (web maps, data visualizations) to support interpretive and educational work.

##### K-12 Education (1 position)

The K-12 intern will assist K-12 education staff with a project to overhaul the existing LMEC teaching materials available online. This intern will be able to learn more about teaching in a K-12 setting and creating curriculum material that can bring the LMEC collection into classrooms that serve a variety of subjects and ages.

##### Development & Fundraising (1 position)

The development and fundraising intern will work with LMEC Development Coordinator to support both ongoing donor engagement and new, strategic grant-focused projects that will fund future Map Center research and work. Building development skills can be useful for a wide variety of career fields, including the museum and library world, non-profit organizations, and art & humanities/community-focused entities. The student chosen for the role will use their strong research and writing skills to help find grant prospects, craft regular communications to donors and patrons, and conduct direct outreach to potential organizational partners.

### **Compensation & Role Details**

* Dates: Mid-January through mid-May 2023
* Hours: 6-10 hours/week
* Compensation: $15.35/hour
