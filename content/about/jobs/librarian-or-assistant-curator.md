Historical GIS, and modern geospatial information in the domain of
critical data literacy. As the Center continues to grow its collections

CIRCLE (Collections, Interpretation, Research, Community Learning, and
Exhibitions) working group, and will work closely with the Cataloging &
Reference Librarian as well as the Public Engagement & Interpretation
Coordinator to support access to the collections from existing
constituencies such as researchers and library patrons, as well as
actively seeking opportunities to build interest in geospatial
information and digital mapmaking amongst new constituencies.

The Librarian or Assistant Curator will also work in collaboration with
the Center's Education working group, assisting on projects involving
geospatial data sets and tools for K-12 programs.

Appointments made under the title of Assistant Curator will also be
expected to actively develop the Center's collections in topic areas
relating to the history of digital cartography, critical and radical
cartography of the 20th and 21st centuries and born-digital cartography,
as well as occasionally facilitating exhibitions on these and related
topics. The Assistant Curator position also includes the expectation of
maintaining an active connection with scholarly research in fields such
as human geography, media studies, and digital design.
