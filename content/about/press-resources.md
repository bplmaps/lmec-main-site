## Geography in the News

Almost every news story has a geographic dimension, whether it's merely a dateline, or a more comprehensive investigation into how geography structures local, national, and international issues. The Leventhal Center offers numerous resources for journalists and the media, including subject experts with availability for quotes or comments, research services for journalists, historic and contemporary maps that are available for reprint on permissive licenses, and technical assistance with geospatial data analysis and digital mapping.

To contact the Center with a press inquiry, email <info@leventhalmap.org> or call +1 617.859.2387.
