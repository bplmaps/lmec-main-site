Maddie is a Public Research Fellow at the Leventhal Map & Education Center, a PhD candidate in the American & New England Studies Program at Boston University, and a proud resident of a triple-decker in Cambridge's Port neighborhood. The LMEC's collection will help her piece together a partial history of Black Bostonians' historic preservation efforts from the late nineteenth century onward, a story that comes into clearer focus by reframing what activities constitute preservation work. As a public historian, Maddie wants to collaborate with and bolster Boston's citizen historians. Her project with the LMEC will take the form of a series of walking tours led by residents of their neighborhoods, and, eventually, a series of crowd-sourced audio tours that passengers can listen to while riding the MBTA's T lines and bus routes.
