Alexandra is the Postdoctoral Fellow in the Digital History and Cartography of the American Revolutionary War, a joint position with the Leventhal Map & Education Center and the [Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon](https://www.mountvernon.org/library/). Her primary job is to facilitate the creation of _ARGO: American Revolutionary Geographies Online_, a new digital maps portal meant to increase access to and promote the study of maps of North America created between 1750 and 1800. She is particularly interested in how maps facilitated European expansion and Native dispossession, and the role of the state in settler colonialism during the eighteenth century (as well as weird drawings of animals and funny place names). She holds an MA from Dalhousie University and a PhD in Early American History from the University of Pennsylvania.
