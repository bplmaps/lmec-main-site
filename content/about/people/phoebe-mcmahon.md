Phoebe (she/her) is a student at Tufts University majoring in Environmental Studies and International Literary Visual Studies. She loves maps because they make a wide range of topics easier and more fun to understand. She is particularly interested in thinking about what’s not represented by maps—whose voices are heard and whose are left out. She can’t wait to apply her artistic background while working as a geospatial intern, as well as learn more about the history of the Boston area!
