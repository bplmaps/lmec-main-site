Zoe is a student at the Boston Latin School and is spending the summer as a Seevak Fellow at the Map Center working on public projects related to maps and social justice, and georeferencing atlases for [Atlascope](https://www.atlascope.org/). Alongside her drive to explore Bostonâ€™s history through a queer, racial, and artistic lens, Zoe incorporates her love of astrophysics and computer science into her work by combining critical thinking with technological skills.
