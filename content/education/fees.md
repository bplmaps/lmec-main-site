## About our fee structure

Our fee structure helps underwrite our free public services, and helps us to defer the cost of staff time to carry out programs. **All of our programs and events which are carried out for the general public are provided free of charge to participants.** In addition, admission to our exhibition gallery, research and reference services, and access to the Rare Maps Reading Room are **always free**.

Cost should not present a barrier for bringing our educational programs to your students. If your district or institution is not able to support our standard fees, [please send us an email](mailto:info@leventhalmap.org) to discuss adjusted rates.
