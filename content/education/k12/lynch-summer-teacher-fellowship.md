### About the Fellowship

Unlock the power of maps and primary sources to transform your classroom and bring Boston’s rich history to life as a Lynch Fellow. 

This year participants in the Carolyn A. Lynch Summer Teacher Fellowship at the Leventhal Center will engage with LMEC staff and educators from across greater Boston in conversation, collaboration, primary source exploration, and the development of accessible and meaningful learning resources for their students.  

Over the course of the 2025-2026 school year, each educator will complete a project – a lesson plan, inquiry, unit plan, or DBQ – for their classroom on a specific time period or topic in Boston history, using maps and other resources from the Leventhal Center. 

During the 2025 Lynch Fellows Summer Session and in two Saturday sessions during the school year, educators will receive instruction from LMEC staff on teaching with maps, designing instruction, and developing classroom materials, as well as guidance on accessing and using relevant resources from the LMEC collections. As a collaborative cohort, the Lynch Fellows and LMEC staff will explore and refine the best methods to integrate maps into their classroom teaching, provide access points for all students to work with primary source materials, and create structures to support students as they engage in rigorous discussions.

**By the end of the 2025 Lynch Fellowship, Fellows will have:**

- A project, lesson, or resource based on the LMEC collections that they can use with their students during the 2025-2026 school year
- New and expanded skills for teaching with maps and geospatial thinking
- A cohort of like-minded educators, including current Fellows and Lynch Fellowship alumni, with which to share ideas/resources
- A $575 stipend to support the development of instructional materials for their classroom
