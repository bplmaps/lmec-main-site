  2024 Carolyn A. Lynch Summer Teacher Fellowship: Teaching Boston Community
  History
---

**Stipend:** $1000

### About the Fellowship

This summer the Lynch Fellows at the Leventhal Center will focus on developing meaningful resources for their students and other educators. Each educator will complete a project for their classroom on a specific time period or topic in Boston history, past or present. Educators will receive guidance from LMEC staff on relevant resources and also develop the skills to search the LMEC databases to locate future resources. They will also learn from and collaborate with the LMEC Education team and their fellow educators on the best methods to integrate maps into their classroom teaching. 

The 2024 Lynch Fellows will also help shape future LMEC resources for classroom teachers. They will work as a cohort of educators, together with LMEC Education team, to identify the essential characteristics of quality resources for classroom teachers. Lynch Fellows will also aide in the development of tools to assist other educators across the country in searching the Leventhal collections. The work of the Fellows this summer will have a significant impact on the future offerings of the Center.

By the end of the 2024 Fellowship, Fellows will have: 
- A lesson or resource based on the LMEC collection that they can use in their classroom for the ‘24-‘25 school year
- New and expanded skills for teaching with maps and geospatial thinking


### Eligibility

Any K-12 teacher or library media specialist who has an interest in teaching about Boston using maps and wants to create curricula in any content discipline area. Boston Public School teachers are especially encouraged to apply, as are teams of two or more teachers from one school. 

We are especially interested in educators who have interest in the design of asynchronous digital resources for classroom teachers.
