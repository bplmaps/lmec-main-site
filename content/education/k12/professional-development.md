## Workshops

### Upcoming Workshops

**_Small Bites_**: An after-school series of gatherings for educators interested in teaching about Boston through a geospatial and social justice lens.

For the 2021-22 school year the Map Center is offering a series of FREE “small bites” professional development sessions. These 6 sessions will run after school and will be a mix of in-person and Zoom sessions designed to send you off with great map-based lessons and resources to immediately implement in your classroom. All K-12 teachers are welcome. Sign up for one or all of them!
