> “Maps to me are now dynamic, vibrant, alive and worth engaging” –Teacher Workshop Participant

The Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center offers a variety of professional development opportunities for educators. All workshops expand educators’ views of the ways in which they can use maps, not just to teach geography, but opening up the possibilities for using these resources as starting points for a variety of lessons in various subject areas.

Sign up for our [Education Mailing List](https://www.leventhalmap.org/education-mailing-list/) for news on professional development opportunities.

### Carolyn A. Lynch Summer Teacher Fellowship

The summer teacher fellowship is open to any K-12 teacher or library media specialist and has a different focus each year. Fellows work with Map Center educators and librarians to research in our collections, create curriculum and learn from one another. Boston Public School teachers are especially encouraged to apply. The application process opens up in February. Please join our education mailing list to receive updates.
