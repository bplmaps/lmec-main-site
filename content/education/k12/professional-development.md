#### Lifting as We Climb: Black Women's Activism in turn-of-the-20th-century Boston

##### July 10 - 12, 2023

Join us in a three-day workshop designed in conjunction with our current exhibition, [Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/building-blocks/), to expand your knowledge and comfort in teaching the role and impact of women in Boston's Black history. Develop an appreciation for how space is occupied: physical, intellectual, emotional, and where the spaces for legacy exist. Explore ideas of memory at different geographic and cultural scales. Gain confidence in accessing resources and archives, especially maps, to support teaching these concepts.

Presenters include:

Artist and Educator [L'Merchie Frazier](http://lmerchiefrazier.org/)

##### Empowering Maptivists: Using Maps & Data to Teach Social Justice Topics

Maps are instruments of power and can affect our understanding of issues and data depending on who is telling the story. It is our job as map consumers and educators to think critically about what maps are showing us (and what they aren’t). In _Empowering Maptivists_, course participants will explore the unique power of maps to make sense of the world around us. The course will provide clear pathways for helping students explore issues in their own communities and use spatial understanding to advocate for change.

Join us for this self-paced online professional development course hosted by the National Humanities Center. It's all virtual and you will earn 35 professional development hours. There are two six-week windows.
