## Workshops

### Upcoming Workshops

**Coming soon!**

**_Small Bites_**: An after-school series of gatherings for educators interested in teaching about Boston through a geospatial and social justice lens.

For the 2021-22 school year the Map Center is offering a series of FREE “small bites” professional development sessions. These 6 sessions will run after school and will be a mix of in-person and Zoom sessions designed to send you off with great map-based lessons and resources to immediately implement in your classroom. All K-12 teachers are welcome. Sign up for one or all of them!

{{< course-listing image="/uploads/wiam.png" title="What Is A Map?" subtitle="Grades 1–3" description="Students practice how to interpret maps by reading the stories being told by mapmakers. Students create a map of their own, receive a short interactive lesson about maps and mapping, and work in small groups to answer questions about some of the maps in our collection.">}}

{{< title="Thursday, September 23 from 3:00 to 5:30" subtitle="**_The Educator Social and Map Giveaway at the Leventhal Map & Education Center (in person)_**" description="Drop in when you can and stay as long, or as little, as you like!

Our first get-together is an opportunity for you to meet us and each other, tour our new exhibition [Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception](https://www.leventhalmap.org/education/k12/professional-development/), load up your vehicle with free classroom maps (from class sets to beautiful large wall maps of the world), and enjoy some small bites!">}}
