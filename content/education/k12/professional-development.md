### Visualizing Change in Boston: Using Digital Commonwealth Collections to Tell Stories of Places and Activism

Using Digital Commonwealth Collections to Tell Stories of Places and Activism

Digital Commonwealth's Membership and Outreach & Education Committees invite you to register for the following workshop:

Educators from the [Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center](https://www.leventhalmap.org/) at the Boston Public Library will discuss [“Activism in Boston Over Time,”](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/for_educators/primary_source_sets/activism_in_boston_over_time) a new primary source set and an accompanying lesson they created for Digital Commonwealth. In this lesson, students use maps, photos and other resources to construct a narrative of how different locations in Boston changed over time and the role of activism in the change. This lesson can serve as a model for any educators across the Commonwealth considering how to teach about the role of citizen action in their local communities.

This workshop is designed for K-12 educators but anyone interested in this topic is invited to participate.

Come prepared to participate as we'll be trying out the lesson together!

**When:** Wed Sep 28 2022, 3:00-4:30 PM ET;  Register by Tuesday, September 27.

### Empowering Maptivists: Using Maps & Data to Examine Social Issues in the Humanities Classroom

Maps are instruments of power and can affect our understanding of issues and data depending on who is telling the story. It is our job as map consumers and educators to think critically about what maps are showing us (and what they aren’t). In _Empowering Maptivists_, course participants will explore the unique power of maps to make sense of the world around us. The course will provide clear pathways for helping students explore issues in their own communities and use spatial understanding to advocate for change.

Join us for this self-paced online professional development course hosted by the National Humanities Center. It's all virtual and you will earn 35 professional development hours. There are two six-week windows. [**Register here**](https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/education-programs/courses/empowering-maptivists-using-maps-data-to-examine-social-issues-humanities-classroom/) for the time frame that works best for you.
