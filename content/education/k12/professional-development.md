### **_More or Less in Common_: Teaching Environmental Justice and Activism in Massachusetts and Beyond**

###### July 11 - 13, 2022, 9:00AM - 3:00PM

Who benefits when the natural world is flourishing and healthy? By contrast, who is harmed by a dangerous and degraded environment? This three-day workshop for educators in grades 3-12, hosted in Boston and Lowell, will focus on past and present ideas of environmental justice, looking closely at eastern Massachusetts and the reality of its post-industrial landscape. Through local case studies that incorporate maps, data, documents, and physical landscapes, participants will learn about activists' work and develop their own lessons/activities to use in the classroom. This workshop will feature ideas and models for student-led civics projects connected to environmental justice.

Co-presented by the Norman B. Leventhal Map and Education Center and Tsongas Industrial History Center

### Empowering Maptivists: Using Maps & Data to Examine Social Issues in the Humanities Classroom

Maps are instruments of power and can affect our understanding of issues and data depending on who is telling the story. It is our job as map consumers and educators to think critically about what maps are showing us (and what they aren’t). In _Empowering Maptivists_, course participants will explore the unique power of maps to make sense of the world around us. The course will provide clear pathways for helping students explore issues in their own communities and use spatial understanding to advocate for change.

Join us for this self-paced online professional development course hosted by the National Humanities Center. It's all virtual and you will earn 35 professional development hours. There are two six-week windows. [**Register here**](https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/education-programs/courses/empowering-maptivists-using-maps-data-to-examine-social-issues-humanities-classroom/) for the time frame that works best for you.
