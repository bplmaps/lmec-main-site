### Upcoming Workshops

##### Mapping a New World: Places of Conflict and Colonization in 17th-Century New England

July 12-16, 2021  
July 26-30, 2021

The [Norman B. Leventhal Map Center at Boston Public Library](http://leventhalmap.org/) is pleased to invite 3rd-12th grade teachers from around the country to apply to participate in our summer [2021 NEH Landmarks of American History and Culture](https://www.neh.gov/grants/education/landmarks-american-history-and-culture-workshops-school-teachers) teacher workshop: _Mapping a New World: Places of Conflict and Colonization in 17th-Century New England_. **This workshop will be offered in a remote format, fully online.**

During this week of virtual learning, participants will explore the history and landscape of 1600s New England, with an emphasis on the role of geography and place. The course will be a blend of synchronous and asynchronous opportunities for participants to engage meaningfully with our partners at the workshop's featured landmarks including Plimoth Patuxet Museums, the Mashantucket Pequot Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

Teachers will engage with leading scholars and primary source materials, including period maps, letters, land deeds, and narratives that are grounded in their geographic location. These materials illuminate how the different ways and perspectives with which English settlers and multifaceted Native communities viewed the New England region shaped their relationships and interactions throughout the 1600s.

**Deadline to Apply: March 1, 2021**
