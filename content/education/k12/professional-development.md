{{< alert-box type="primary" title="Summer 2025 Virtual Teacher Workshops" >}}
**We know summer means different things to different teachers**—rest, time with people you care about, summer jobs, caregiving, or finally tackling your neglected to-do list.

If you're also using this time to recharge *and* get inspired for next year, we’d love to have you join us for one (or more!) of our upcoming virtual workshops on the American Revolution, offered as part of [ARGO](https://www.argomaps.org/) (American Revolutionary Geographies Online).

**Can’t attend live?** No problem. All registrants will receive access to the session recording and materials. (Just a heads up—these are only available to registered participants and won’t be shared publicly.)

We hope to see you this summer!

### Making the Revolution Local (Virtual)

**Part One:** **Beyond George Washington Slept Here: How Maps Can Expand Our Understanding of Historic Events**

*Wednesday July 16 at 10AM*

The American Revolution was as much about places as it was about people or ideas. In this session, we’ll explore how geography shaped events—and how guided inquiry with historic maps can bring that complexity to life in your classroom. You’ll leave with ready-to-use primary sources and teaching strategies for middle school students.

**Part Two:** **The Revolution Today: Using Digital Tools to Connect Past and Present**

*Wednesday July 23 at 10AM*

In Part Two, we’ll dive into [ARGO](https://www.argomaps.org/) (American Revolutionary Geographies Online), a suite of digital tools designed to link past and present. Learn how to georeference historic maps and help students see what has changed—and what hasn’t.

### Teaching 250: Using Maps to Teach the American Revolution (Virtual)
