## Maps teach many lessons

At the Leventhal Map & Education Center, we believe that maps are powerful tools for students to consider their place in their community and the larger world. By looking closely at maps from the past, present and even possible futures, students can connect themselves to larger systems that affect them and propose ideas for change. Giving students the tools to read and understand maps and the time to look closely and deeply at them can expand not only their geographic awareness but also help them to look critically at other sources of information they encounter.

In early 2024, due to staffing changes in our education department, **we will not be offering school programs from January through March**. This programming pause includes both field trips to the Leventhal Center as well as outreach visits to schools. We anticipate beginning school programs again in April and opening booking in mid-winter. 

Meanwhile, you can:

* [Subscribe to our mailing list](https://www.leventhalmap.org/subscribe/) so we can update you on when our bookings will begin again in 2024
* [Find resources for teaching your own programs with maps](/education/k12/teach-it-yourself/)
* [Apply to our summer 2024 NEH Institute for K-12 Educators](https://teachingwithmaps.org)
* [Contact our education department for more resources](mailto:education@leventhalmap.org)

We look forward to reopening our partnerships for school programs again in the spring!
