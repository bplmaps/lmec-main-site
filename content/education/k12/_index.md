## Maps teach many lessons

At the Leventhal Map & Education Center, we believe that maps are powerful tools for students to consider their place in their community and the larger world. By looking closely at maps from the past, present and even possible futures, students can connect themselves to larger systems that affect them and propose ideas for change. Giving students the tools to read and understand maps and the time to look closely and deeply at them can expand not only their geographic awareness but also help them to look critically at other sources of information they encounter.
