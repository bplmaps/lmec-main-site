The Leventhal Map & Education Center offers a menu of pre-designed programs for field trips to our Learning Center. Using maps from our collection, students practice using cartographic tools to read maps and think about what maps can and can’t tell us about our relationships to places in the past and present.

Our program offerings will always include an option related to the current exhibition on display in our gallery at the Central Library. All programs are led by Leventhal Center staff educators.

## Guided Class Visit Programs
