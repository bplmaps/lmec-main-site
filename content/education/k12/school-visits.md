The Leventhal Map & Education Center offers engaging, inquiry-based programs for K-12 students that encourage critical thinking through maps. Our Education Team leads programs for students both at the Leventhal Center at the BPL in Copley Square and remotely through virtual classroom visits for students outside of Boston. Using a guided inquiry approach, we support and challenge all learners to explore how maps shape our understanding of the past and present.

Students investigate Boston’s dynamic history by studying what has changed—and what has stayed the same—using both historic and contemporary maps.</br></br>Together, we explore how geography and key decisions by individuals have shaped the city we call home. This tour can also be tailored to highlight a specific moment or theme your class is studying, helping students make meaningful local connections.">}}

## Workshops
These 80-minute workshops invite high school students to think critically, collaborate with peers, and make meaningful connections between historical and contemporary topics. 

Designed for groups of 12 to 32 students, workshops are offered on Thursdays at 9:30 am and 11:00 am.

## Virtual Guided Class Visits
The Leventhal Map & Education Center offers live, interactive programs for K-12 classrooms through Zoom. Led by our experienced educators, these virtual visits showcase maps and materials from our collection in your classroom. 

We focus on topics ranging from introductory map skills to indigenous erasure to the American Revolution to urban planning. Students actively participate through discussion, inquiry-based activities, and collaborative learning.

We offer the following guided class visits in a 30-45 minute synchronous virtual format.

Unfortunately, the Central Library in Copley Square does not offer reserved off-street parking for buses or other vehicles. However, several garages are within walking distance of the Leventhal Center, and two-hour metered street parking, though often occupied, is available throughout the Back Bay.
