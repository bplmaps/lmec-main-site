The Leventhal Map & Education Center offers a menu of pre-designed programs on different topics, see the list below. Using maps from our collection, students practice using cartographic tools to read maps and think about what maps can and can't tell us about our relationships to places in the past and present. Programs related to our current exhibition are also available, and class visits to the Map Center often include activities that explore our exhibition gallery. In addition to our pre-designed programs, we are happy to work with you to create programming that works with your curriculum.

**Fees:** With the exception of Boston Public Schools groups, the Leventhal Map Center charges a $100 fee per program visit to the Map Center to support educational programming and conservation work . We also bring selected programs into local classrooms for a programming fee; see our [outreach programs](https://www.leventhalmap.org/education/outreach-programs/) for more information.  Remote sessions are charged at the $100 rate. We provide **_all_** of our programming free of charge to Boston Public Schools.  
**Time:** Our programs typically run between 1-1.5 hours, with longer sessions allowing for more discussion and inquiry.  
**Group size:** We cannot accommodate groups larger than 40 at a time. As groups larger than 20 may require that we reserve extra space, please be as specific as possible when completing our reservation form.
