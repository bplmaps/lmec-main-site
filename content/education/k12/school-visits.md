Participants practice how to read and think about maps using the Leventhal Map & Education Center collection. Programs also often include activities that explore our current gallery exhibition. The Map Center has worked with teachers to develop sessions on French colonization and the spread of language, GIS asset/advocacy mapping of Boston neighborhoods, immigration to Boston past and present, and many other topics. We will work with you to create programming that works with your curriculum.
