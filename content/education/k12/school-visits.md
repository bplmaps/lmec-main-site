{{< alert-box type="warning" icon="fas fa-laptop-house" title="Remote Instruction Only" >}} We are not currently offering in-person education programs. If you are interested in having Map Center education staff teach a virtual lesson for your class, please fill out the reservation form below and we will get back to you. {{< /alert-box >}}

The Leventhal Map & Education Center offers a menu of pre-designed programs for field trips to our Learning Center, virtual class visits, or in-person outreach to classrooms. Using maps from our collection, students practice using cartographic tools to read maps and think about what maps can and can't tell us about our relationships to places in the past and present. Programs related to our current exhibition are also available. Explore our program topics below. If you don't see quite what you're looking for, we are happy to work with you to create programming that works with your curriculum.

## Pre-Designed K-12 Programming

{{< course-listing image="/uploads/eliot5.jpg" title="What Is A Map?" subtitle="Grades 1–4" description="This program teaches students how to interpret maps by encouraging them to read the stories being told by mapmakers. Students create a map of their school, receive a short interactive lesson about maps and mapping, and work in small groups to answer questions about some of the maps in our collection."

#### Program Fees

_Map Center Field Trips or Remote class visits_: With the exception of Boston Public Schools groups, the Leventhal Map Center charges a $100 fee per program visit to the Map Center to support educational programming and conservation work. Remote sessions are charged at the $100 rate. We provide _all_ of our programming free of charge to Boston Public Schools.

_Outreach visits to schools:_ Outreach fees are calculated based on the total number of sessions booked per program topic.  
One session: $175  
Two sessions: $300  
Three sessions: $400  
Four or more sessions: $400 for the first 3 sessions + $50 for each additional session

This is no additional charge if multiple days are needed to accommodate the total number of sessions per outreach program.

We will travel to any school that is within the I-495 corridor of Massachusetts, but additional travel fees of $0.55/mile apply if travel distance is over 25 miles from the Leventhal Map & Education Center.

#### Notes on Field Trips to the Map Center

Programs are 75 – 90 minutes long. Longer sessions allow for more discussion and inquiry. We cannot accommodate groups larger than 40 at a time. As groups larger than 20 may require that we reserve extra space, please be as specific as possible when completing our reservation form.

Please note that there is no designated lunch area for classes in the Boston Public Library.

#### Notes on Outreach Programs

Programs are 60 - 90 minutes long and are intended for individual classrooms of 30 or fewer students. Longer sessions allow for more discussion and inquiry. We can accommodate larger groups over multiple program sessions.

Classrooms should have a computer and a digital projector or smartboard and space for students to work in small groups of 4 to 5 students for hands-on map inquiry exercises. We can provide a laptop and projector if necessary.
