### Finding the right map

When you search the Leventhal Center online database, you might not find your “perfect” map right away.

<details>
    <summary><strong>Picking the Right Search Terms</strong></summary>
    <p>Try different search terms including location, year, and key words. You may need to look through many results to find what you were looking for (or what you didn’t know you were looking for).</p>
    <p>For example, if you search for <code>“Boston”</code> in our collection, you will receive 10,876 results. You can make this search more manageable by narrowing the year or type of map you are looking for. You might find better results if you look for <code>“Boston Common”</code> or <code>“Boston 1775”</code>.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary><strong>Refining Your Search</strong></summary>
    <p>Researchers often find it helpful to use quotation marks when they search to refine their results.</p>
    <p>For example, if you search for <code>Treaty of Versailles</code> (with no quotation marks), you will produce 112 results, including maps of the gardens of the palace of Versailles. If you search <code>“Treaty of Versailles”</code> with quotation marks, you will receive three results related to the treaties of 1783 and 1919.</p>

### Using a map in your NHD Project

Our number one piece of advice? **Take time to look.**

Just as you would read and reread any other primary source document, be sure to examine carefully your selected map.

You can look over the map with the following questions in mind:

* Take a second to take in the whole image (we like to scan with our eyes from top to bottom, from left to right).
* What do you notice first?
* What does the map focus on?
  * How did the maker get you to focus? Did they use color? Are some things larger than others (scale)? What is at the center of the map? What features are accompanied by text?
* How is the map intended to be used?
  * To show political boundaries? Navigation? Sharing data? Depicting a particular place for promotion or propaganda?
* What is overlooked? What is unlabeled, at the edges, or missing altogether?

### Final Steps

* Cite
  * Every digital entry includes a “cite” option under “share”. You can find additional information in the catalog listing under "item information".
* High quality image
  * Each digital entry includes multiple download sizes. Be sure you chose the right size for the way you will be using your map.
