Students create a map of their own, receive a short interactive lesson about maps and mapping, and work in small groups to answer questions about some of the maps in our collection."

{{< course-listing image="/uploads/2021-05-13/ioway2.png" title="Native People and Settler Colonialism: A Story of Land and Maps" subtitle="Grades 4-12" description="Students explore maps made by Indigenous People and Euro-Americans to interrogate differing conceptions of land and how maps can document and be used as tools of land dispossession, cultural genocide, and resistance. In Lesson One, students look closely at a 19th century map made by a Bájoxe (Ioway) leader and contrast it with Euro-American maps of the same period. In Lesson Two, students work in small groups to analyze how Euro-Americans represented Indigenous People on 19th century maps and finish by looking at how Native People have used mapping to write new narratives." lessonFile="https://bostonpubliclibrary.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/LeventhalMap/EePAxZt-mupMmRBn-ej4-SYBEvqeizGusu7-jJkLr1fmGw?e=qdJs33" >}}
