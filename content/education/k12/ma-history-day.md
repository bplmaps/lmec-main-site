>The Leventhal Map & Education Center sponsors an annual "Best Use of Maps as a Primary Source" prize for two students each year who enter [NHD Massachusetts.](https://www.masshist.org/masshistoryday) This page presents some larger ways to think about maps as part of NHD projects. Check out the [National History Day page](https://www.nhd.org/) to learn more about this year's theme. 

Maps help to ground historical events and themes in place. We know from the inclusion of maps in contemporary news articles that people rely on maps to help them visualize, contextualize and make connections to unfamiliar places. In presenting learning about times past, a geographic element may be even more important, as even the landscape of places we are intimate with today can seem radically remote when we turn back the clock. And so we turn to maps!

Here are some tips for using maps in History Day projects:
- **Presentation:** It is very frustrating to come upon a map image that is hard to read, i.e.too small or too blurry to see important details and labels. If you are going to incorporate a map into your project, be sure your reader/viewer can use it to see clearly the information you want them to see. Many digital map collections have high resolution images for download in many formats: .pdf, .jpeg, .tif. Be sure that the file format and image resolution you choose gives you a sharp and clear image. 
- **Purpose:** Which leads us to, what do you want your readers to see in the map and why? If you want your audience simply to learn where a county in Massachusetts is in relation to the state as a whole, you will choose a very different map than if you want your audience to see how many properties a particular landowner possessed in that county. Decide what your purpose is and make sure your map presents the information in an understandable and readable way.
- **Give credit where credit is due:** Make sure you source the map. The important elements are creator/cartographer, title of the map, date it was made, and where the map lives (what archive, collection, book, report, etc.).  Make it easy for someone who is interested in your project or a related topic to find the map on their own. Archives and collections can be difficult to navigate. For your own accountability and the righteous cause of public access to our shared history, make sure your citations are on point.
- **Serendipity:** Be open to the fact that you might not find the perfect map but you might find something even better. You've likely seen many maps in textbooks and other sources that show historical events and locations. These can be very useful but might not be as interesting as historical sources. Consider that many historical maps may tell you a lot by what they leave out, rename, or highlight. Browsing across a variety of different archives and sources is recommended and may turn up some really compelling maps!
