**Applications due:** April 30, 2021

### **About the Fellowship**

Are you a teacher who teaches Boston history or contemporary issues in Boston?

Do you engage your students in project-based learning connected to Boston neighborhoods and social justice issues?

Would you like to incorporate more maps in your classroom practice?

If you answered “Yes!” then join the Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center (LMEC) this summer as a teacher fellow. As a summer fellow you will:

* Work with Map Center education staff and librarians to find compelling resources to use in your classroom from the LMEC and Boston Public Library.
* Learn basic GIS mapmaking and other digital tools to further engage students in critical thinking about their city.
* Adapt and create lessons to use in your classroom. Of particular interest are teachers who are interested in using and adapting many of the Map Center’s lessons from their elective class “Boston Maptivists” at the Burke High School for use in their own classrooms.

### **Who can apply?**

Any K-12 teacher or library media specialist who has an interest in teaching about Boston using maps and wants to create curricula in any content discipline area. Special consideration given to educators exploring issues of social justice in some way. _Boston Public School teachers are especially encouraged to apply_, _as are teams of two or more teachers from one school_

### **Expectations**

* As a cohort, teachers will meet virtually for four meetings over the summer (dates TBD). Dates will all be in June/July/August and will be coordinated with Map Center staff. LMEC education staff will also schedule regular check-ins individually with fellows over the course of the summer.
* A final project must be completed by the end of August. Final projects can be lessons and activities incorporating primary sources, including maps, from the collections of the Leventhal Map & Education Center and Boston Public Library as well as other resources.
* Fellows must be willing to have their projects shared with the larger teaching community, online, and in person to other teachers as part of professional development (TBD).

## **To apply**

#### **Deadline: Friday, April 30, 2021**

* A current CV
* A description of no more than one page stating how your current teaching connects to the areas listed above and how you envision revising and expanding your current lessons. If applying as a team, please submit one page as a team.

**Don’t take our word for it! Ask our 2020 Fellows:**

> ... I loved getting to spend so much time engaging with maps. It was such fun to geek out with other teachers who were equally excited to play with maps! I also got so much out of the push to use maps and mapmaking in a more consistent and meaningful way in my classroom.

> It was an incredible blend of learning something new and producing something practical and usable for my classroom.

> There was an incredible vibe. I don't always love experiences like these where I have to meet new people. But because of the way it was set up I was really able to value their work, see them as colleagues, and want to get their feedback. That was really nice.
