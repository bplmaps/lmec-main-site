**Applications due:** May 2, 2022

**Stipend:** $1000

### **About the Fellowship**

_Are you a teacher who teaches Boston history or contemporary issues in Boston?_

_Do you engage your students in project-based learning connected to Boston neighborhoods and social justice issues?_

_Would you like to incorporate more Boston-area maps in your classroom practice?_

If you answered “Yes!” to any of the above questions, then join the Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center (LMEC) this summer as a teacher fellow. As a summer fellow you will:

* Work with Map Center education staff and librarians to find compelling resources to use in your classroom from the LMEC and Boston Public Library.
* Learn basic GIS mapmaking and other digital tools to further engage students in critical thinking about their city.
* Adapt and create lessons to use in your classroom. Many of the Center’s existing [Maptivist lessons](https://www.leventhalmap.org/education/k12/maptivists/) can be adapted for use in your classroom as well as the [Atlascope tool](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/) for exploring change over time in Boston’s neighborhoods.

### **Who can apply?**

Any K-12 teacher or library media specialist who has an interest in teaching about Boston using maps and wants to create curricula in any content discipline area. Special consideration given to educators exploring issues of social justice in some way. _Boston Public School teachers are especially encouraged to apply_, _as are teams of two or more teachers from one school_

### **Expectations**

* As a cohort, teachers will meet in person 3 times over the summer (dates TBD). Dates will all be in June/July/August and will be coordinated with Map Center staff. LMEC education staff will also schedule check-ins individually with fellows over the course of the summer.
* A final project must be completed by the end of August. Final projects can be lessons and activities incorporating primary sources, including maps, from the collections of the Leventhal Map & Education Center and Boston Public Library as well as other resources.
* Fellows must be willing to have their projects shared with the larger teaching community, online, and in person to other teachers as part of professional development (TBD).

### **To apply**

#### **Deadline: Monday, May 2nd, 2022**

_To apply, please send:_

* A current CV
* A description of no more than one page stating how your current teaching connects to the areas listed above and how you envision revising and expanding your current lessons. If applying as a team, please submit one page as a team.
* A letter of support from your school principal or department head.

**Don’t take our word for it! Ask our 2021 Fellows:**

> _"The flexibility of the program to make what we are doing meaningful to our students first and foremost \[was something I liked about being a fellow\]. We clearly teach in very different contexts with specific needs, requirements, etc. and I appreciated how \[the center\] honored that diversity.”_
>
> _“I was not even considering using ArcGIS with students before this fellowship. The whole idea was intimidating and I wasn't aware it was free through ESRI. Learning about it in pieces (and especially in the training you expertly led us through) makes me feel like I have the tools to create experiences with students.”_
>
> _“I am thinking a lot more deeply about maps and how the data used to generate them can serve so many purposes and agendas. However, teaching students to think critically while teaching them how to use and make maps is endlessly rich and something I want to bring into daily classroom instruction.”_
