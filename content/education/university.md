## Opening about people and places

Course topics which may relate to our collections strengths include historical geography, environmental history, urban history and urban studies, the history of science, American studies, local and regional history of Boston and New England, GIS and geospatial techniques, critical cartography, digital humanities, and other related themes.

## Visiting the Map Center with a class

{{< alert-box type="warning" icon="fas fa-laptop-house" title="Remote instruction only" >}}Due to the continued closure of the BPL and LMEC for the COVID-19 pandemic, all instruction in Spring 2021 will take place remotely.{{</ alert-box >}}

The LMEC curatorial and library team welcomes university classes to “visit” our collections and exhibition remotely. We offer **broad overview lessons** on historical geography, critical cartography, and research in the map collections, as well as **thematically-focused discussions** of specific groups of objects. We also offer **instruction in digital methods** for geography and cartography.

To schedule a remote visit or talk for your class, please fill out this form:

For more information or to request a discussion about how to bring the Map Center’s resources into your digital classroom, please contact the [Curator](about/people/garrett-nelson).

## Collaborative learning in the digital humanities

LMEC encourages and supports student projects that engage with our digital materials to produce new interpretive frames around the collection.

For courses where technical training is not the primary earning objective, we offer highly-scaffolded assignments involving pre-built tools such as the Annotated Map Story generator (see examples on the Mashpee Wampanoag or the construction of the Tremont Street Subway) or the MapWarper georeferencer.

For courses where students are expected to work with more sophisticated digital and technical skills, we offer numerous resources, from IIIF image API endpoints to interactive maps built in OpenLayers, Leaflet, or Mapbox.
