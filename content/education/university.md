## Mapping across the curriculum

Our collections, research programs, and public projects resonate with many different course topics at the university level, both in the humanities and social sciences and beyond. Some of the topics which are well-suited for collaborative learning include:

* historical geography and environmental history
* urban history and urban studies
* history of science and technology
* American studies
* local and regional history of Boston and New England
* GIS and geospatial methods
* critical cartography
* digital humanities
* media studies

We welcome university teachers to [bring your students to the Map Center](#class-visits) for a virtual visit, or to [work with us](#collaborative-learning) in developing a course exercise that draws on historical collections or digital humanities skills. For students, we offer [many resources](#student-research) that may be helpful for research papers, presentations, and creative projects.

## Visiting the Map Center with a class{#class-visits}

{{< alert-box type="warning" icon="fas fa-laptop-house" title="Remote instruction only" >}}Due to the continued closure of the BPL and LMEC for the COVID-19 pandemic, all instruction in Spring 2021 will take place remotely.{{</ alert-box >}}

The LMEC curatorial and library team welcomes university classes to “visit” our collections and exhibition remotely. We offer **broad overview lessons** on historical geography, critical cartography, Boston history, and research in the map collections, as well as **thematically-focused discussions** of specific groups of objects or exhibition topics. We also offer **instruction in digital methods** for geography and cartography.

To schedule a remote visit or talk for your class, please fill out this form:

#### Cost

Teaching and learning visits are provided without fee. However, if you have access to an institutionally-supported budget for curricular extensions, we appreciate any contribution that you can make towards supporting our free programming.

## Collaborative learning in the digital humanities{#collaborative-learning}

LMEC encourages and supports student projects that engage with our digital materials to produce new interpretive frames around the collection.

For courses where technical training is not the primary earning objective, we offer highly-scaffolded assignments involving pre-built tools such as the Annotated Map Story generator (see examples on the Mashpee Wampanoag or the construction of the Tremont Street Subway) or the MapWarper georeferencer.

For courses where students are expected to work with more sophisticated digital and technical skills, we offer numerous resources, from IIIF image API endpoints to interactive maps built in OpenLayers, Leaflet, or Mapbox.

## Resources for student researchers{#student-research}
