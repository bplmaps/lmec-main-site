#### Do you need technical assistance on a cartographic project?

With our *Grants in Aid for Works in Progress* program, the Leventhal Map & Education Center seeks to support researchers and scholars whose projects land at the intersection of historical geography, urban civic data, and digital humanities.

This program is oriented towards 1) projects that are well-aligned with LMECâ€™s priority areas, and 2) applicants who have a well-defined vision for their project, but may lack the technical expertise to bring it to fruition without guidance or support.

Applications are reviewed on a monthly basis and will be awarded based on the capacity of Leventhal Center staff time.
