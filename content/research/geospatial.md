Most of the maps that are produced today and over the course of the past two decades consist of computer-based geographic information. The Leventhal Map & Education Center offers geospatial information services to help you create, find, manipulate and preserve information stored in digital formats compatible with mapping software and GIS (Geographic Information Systems).

## Services We Provide

Our geospatial information library staff can help you with:

* Personalized, **one-on-one research consultations** about your GIS data or mapping project 
* Someone to talk with about where to find online data and software resources
* Tips for structuring your own data or reformatting existing data for new purposes 
* Access to important or useful datasets, especially those related to Boston and Massachusetts 
* Guides and tutorials on how to find and work with GIS data 
* Documentation about LMEC's geospatial humanities projects 
* A friendly resource for best practices on managing geographic information in historic archives

#### GIS Data Formats
We can help you create, find, manipulate and preserve geospatial data formatted as:
*  Points, lines or polygons 
*  Images of maps transformed to real-life geographies 
*  Spreadsheets or tabular data with records containing locations 

#### GIS Mapping Software
We can point you to learning resources for GIS mapping software such as:
*  QGIS free desktop software 
*  ArcGIS commercial desktop suite 
*  Cloud mapping platforms like ArcGIS Online 
*  Custom web map development environments like Leaflet 


## Cartinal: The LMEC Documentation Database

We maintain a portal called [Cartinal](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/cartinal/) with numerous guides, tutorial, and documentation sources for geospatial data and projects. Cartinal includes both step-by-step guides that are suitable for beginners who have never worked with GIS before, as well as more technical documentation for data services and resources provided by LMEC.

Some examples of resources you can find in Cartinal:

- A tutorial for [getting started installing the open source GIS software QGIS](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/cartinal/guides/get-started-qgis/)
- A guide explaining [common geospatial data formats](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/cartinal/guides/file-formats.html)
- Documentation on [how to use the Atlascope portal](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/cartinal/guides/atlascope-tool-guide.html) to access our geotransformed atlas layers


## Make a Geospatial Reference Request {#make-request}

To schedule a research consultation please fill out our Geospatial Reference Request Form. The information in this form will help us understand the nature of your inquiry, ensure your message is quickly delivered to the correct reference librarian, and gets you in the queue for scheduling a consultation over phone or or video chat. _For research requests regarding our historic collections, please see the [Research Appointments](research/appointments) page._

### Other Ways to Contact Us

If our form is not suiting your needs, you can also contact the [Geospatial and Cartographic Information Librarian](about/people/belle-lipton) via telephone or email. Please note that during the COVID-19 closures, phone calls may be received with a delay. 

## Geospatial Project Examples {#example-projects}

Still not sure if you're in the right place? Here are some example geospatial research projects we can help with:

- You are interested in combining different historical sources to investigate the history of a place 
- You attended one of our mapmaking workshops and have followup questions 
- You want to know the best way to get started learning a free mapping software like QGIS 
- You are interested in public health data and want to understand geographic trends 
- You have used our tool [Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org) and want to use some of the historic data layers 
- You are working with historic cartographic materials and want to chat about best practices 
- You are gathering your own data and would like advice on structuring the spatial attributes 
- You have an important Boston dataset you think should be preserved or discoverable
