>[Cartinal](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/cartinal/) includes numerous guides, tutorial, and documentation sources for geospatial data and projects. You'll find both step-by-step guides that are suitable for beginners, as well as more advanced documentation for our data services and resources.

**What kinds of resources can I find in Cartinal?**

* The digital textbook for our newest GIS course, [Making Sense of Maps and Data](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/making-sense-maps-data/)
* A guide explaining [common geospatial data formats](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/file-formats.html)
* Documentation on [how to use the Atlascope portal](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/atlascope-tool-guide.html) to access our geotransformed atlas layers
* And much more!

## The LMEC Data Portal {#data-portal}

[{{< figure src="/uploads/dataportal.png" class="figure-center">}}](https://data.leventhalmap.org)

>As part of a [public data project](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/introducing-our-public-data-project/), the LMEC makes a wide variety of geospatial datasets publicly available. We also developed [our own metadata schema](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/documentation/schema/) for describing GIS data.

**What kinds of data can I find in the LMEC portal?**
* Datasets related to [Boston or New England](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkmv00o45) cleaned up or preserved by the LMEC
* Datasets that are [useful for teaching](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkhm2yhrb)
* Datasets [created during LMEC projects](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkgsk7g8m), programs, or publications
* Datasets relating to [historical geography](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkircu2ol) or BPL map collections

* You'd like to make a map displaying your team's geographic reach or impact
* You are gathering your own data and would like advice on structuring the spatial attributes

### Picking Software

* You want to know the best way to get started learning a free mapping software like QGIS

### Piecing Together the Past

* You are interested in combining different historical sources to investigate the history of a place
* You want to georeference a map or use one of our georeferenced maps

### Managing Collections

* You are working with historic cartographic materials and want to chat about best practices
* You have an important Boston dataset you think should be preserved or discoverable

### Teaching with GIS

* You teach with GIS data and would like to collaborate about resources

### Following Up

* You attended one of our mapmaking workshops and have followup questions
* You have used our tool [Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org) and want to use some of the historic data layers -->
