Most of the maps that are produced today and over the course of the past two decades consist of computer-based geographic information. The Leventhal Map & Education Center offers geospatial information services to help you create, find, manipulate and preserve information stored in digital formats compatible with mapping software and GIS (Geographic Information Systems).

## Cartinal: The LMEC Documentation Database

We maintain a portal called [Cartinal](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/cartinal/) with numerous guides, tutorial, and documentation sources for geospatial data and projects. Cartinal includes both step-by-step guides that are suitable for beginners who have never worked with GIS before, as well as more technical documentation for data services and resources provided by LMEC.

<a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-large" href="https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/">Visit Cartinal</a>

Some examples of resources you can find in Cartinal:

* The digital textbook for our **newest GIS course**: [Making Sense of Maps and Data](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/making-sense-maps-data/)
* A guide explaining [common geospatial data formats](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/file-formats.html)
* Documentation on [how to use the Atlascope portal](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/guides/atlascope-tool-guide.html) to access our geotransformed atlas layers

## LMEC Data Portal {#data-portal}

The LMEC makes geospatial datasets available via the [LMEC Data Portal](http://data.leventhalmap.org/). 

### What kinds of data can I find in the LMEC portal?
* Datasets related to [Boston or New England](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkmv00o45) cleaned up or preserved by the LMEC
* Datasets that are [useful for teaching](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkhm2yhrb)
* Datasets [created during LMEC projects](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkgsk7g8m), programs, or publications
* Datasets relating to [historical geography](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/catalog/dkircu2ol) or BPL map collections

To learn more about the data portal project, you can read about it [here](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/introducing-our-public-data-project/).

To access documentation for the LMEC metadata schema for describing GIS data, you can visit the [schema documentation](https://cartinal.leventhalmap.org/documentation/schema/) made available on Cartinal. 

## What kinds of questions can I ask?

Our geospatial information library staff can help you with:

* Personalized, **one-on-one research consultations** about your GIS data or mapping project
* Someone to talk with about where to find online data and software resources
* Tips for structuring your own data or reformatting existing data for new purposes
* Access to important or useful datasets, especially those related to Boston and Massachusetts
* Guides and tutorials on how to find and work with GIS data
* Documentation about LMEC's geospatial humanities projects
* A friendly resource for best practices on managing geographic information in historic archives

### GIS Data Formats

We can help you create, find, manipulate and preserve geospatial data formatted as:

* Points, lines or polygons
* Images of maps transformed to real-life geographies
* Spreadsheets or tabular data with records containing locations

### GIS Mapping Software

We can point you to learning resources for GIS mapping software such as:

* QGIS free desktop software
* ArcGIS commercial desktop suite
* Cloud mapping platforms like ArcGIS Online
* Custom web map development environments like Leaflet


## Geospatial Project Examples {#example-projects}

Still not sure if you're in the right place? Here are some example projects we can help with:

### Making Use of Online Resources

* You find an online resource difficult to navigate and want to chat with a person

### Getting the Data

* You want direct access to data that speaks to geographic trends. Example topics:
  * public health
  * climate
  * demographic
  * economic
  * education
  * transportation
  * cartographic (borders, prominent features, labels)

### Making a Map

* You'd like to make a map displaying your team's geographic reach or impact
* You are gathering your own data and would like advice on structuring the spatial attributes

### Picking Software

* You want to know the best way to get started learning a free mapping software like QGIS

### Piecing Together the Past

* You are interested in combining different historical sources to investigate the history of a place
* You want to georeference a map or use one of our georeferenced maps

### Managing Collections

* You are working with historic cartographic materials and want to chat about best practices
* You have an important Boston dataset you think should be preserved or discoverable

### Teaching with GIS

* You teach with GIS data and would like to collaborate about resources

### Following Up

* You attended one of our mapmaking workshops and have followup questions
* You have used our tool [Atlascope](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org) and want to use some of the historic data layers
