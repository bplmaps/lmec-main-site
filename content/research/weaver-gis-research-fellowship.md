### GIS research at LMEC

In 2026, made possible by the [Weaver Fund](/donate/weaver-research-fund.md), the Leventhal Center will host an inaugural **David J. Weaver GIS Research Fellow**. With support from subject matter experts on LMEC staff, the Fellowship will allow its recipients to explore and study a growing archive of early GIS maps in the Leventhal Center's [physical collection on the history of computer cartography](/articles/comp-cart-collections). The fellowship will be of interest to scholars and researchers with interests at the intersection of geographic information systems (GIS) history, cartography, urban planning, environmental justice, remote sensing & critical remote sensing, and modern digital mapping.
