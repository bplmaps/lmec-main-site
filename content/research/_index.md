## Research at the Map Center

The Leventhal Map & Education Center offers research services free to the public. We welcome all researchers, whether you are a scholar working on a book manuscript, a Boston resident looking to discover more about the history of your home or neighborhood, or a data analyst looking to find geospatial information about demographic patterns.

### What kind of research questions can the Map Center answer?

Maps and geographic material can be useful for answering countless different types of research questions. To take just a handful of examples, you may find our collections useful if you want to know:

* When did Boston engineers and land speculators [fill in the tidal flats around the Shawmut peninsula](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=shawmut%20peninsula)?
* Who lived in your neighborhood in the nineteenth century, and [when were the houses around yours built](https://atlascope.org)?
* When did the New England states begin managing public lands for recreational purposes?
* How did European cartographers of the [early modern period incorporate new knowledge about the Americas](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_index%5B%5D=all_fields&query%5B%5D=americas&search_index%5B%5D=title&query%5B%5D=&search_index%5B%5D=subject&query%5B%5D=&op=AND&commit=Search&date_start=&date_end=1800&search_field=advanced) into their maps?
* What is the relationship between [race, income, and housing prices in urban areas throughout the United States](https://data.leventhalmap.org/#/search?s=Gentrification)?

### Types of research assistance

* For those wishing to study our collections, see our [collections page](/collections), or [make an appointment](/research/appointments) to access materials in our Rare Maps Reading Room.
