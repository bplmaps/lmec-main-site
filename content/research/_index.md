## Research at the Map Center

The Leventhal Map & Education Center offers research services free to the public. We welcome researchers from all walks of life, whether you are a scholar working on a book manuscript, a Boston resident looking to discover more about the history of your home or neighborhood, or a data analyst looking to find geospatial information about demographic patterns. 

### What kind of research questions can the Map Center answer?

Maps and geographic material can be useful for answer countless different types of research questions. To take just a handful of examples, you may find our collections useful if you want to know:

- When did Boston engineers and land speculators fill in the tidal flats around the Shawmut peninsula?
- Who lived in your neighborhood in the nineteenth century, and when were the houses around yours built?
- When did the New England states begin managing public lands for recreational purposes?
- How did European cartographers of the early modern period incorporate new knowledge about the Americas into their maps?
- What is the relationship between race, income, and housing prices in urban areas throughout the United States?

### Types of research assistance

- For those wishing to study our collections, see our [collections page](collections), or [make an appointment](research/appointments) to access materials in our Rare Maps Reading Room.
- For guides to research sources in both our collections and elsewhere, visit our [research guides](research/guides).
- For help with computer data, spatial anaylsis, and web mapping, see our [geospatial information services](research/geospatial) or [request an appointment with a GIS librarian](research/geospatial/#make-request).
- For scholars and students working on larger projects, learn more about our [fellowships and research support](research/fellowships).
