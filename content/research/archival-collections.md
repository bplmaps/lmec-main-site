An archival collection is a group of related materials that documents the activities of an individual, family, or organization. The Leventhal Map & Education Center's archival collections include personal papers, records of cartographers and surveying firms, and subject-based collections. Archives at LMEC are described in **finding aids**, which include essential information about the creation, content, arrangement, and context of these collections.

Archival collections at the LMEC are listed below. We are currently processing these materials so only some collections are described at this time. [Contact us](mailto:reference@leventhalmap.org) for more information about these collections.
