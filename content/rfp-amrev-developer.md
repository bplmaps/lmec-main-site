A joint endeavor of the [**Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon**](https://www.mountvernon.org/library/) and the **Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library**, the Project Team is creating a web portal consisting of primary source materials on the historical geography of the American Revolutionary era, coupled with rich interpretive essays, galleries, and interactives aimed at both scholarly and general public audiences.Â Building on the Leventhal Center's existing [American Revolution Portal](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/collections/commonwealth:dn39z222j), the expanded project will entail a unified digital interface and catalog that enables convenient open access to high-resolution scans of relevant historic objects, an extensible architecture permitting new institutions to contribute additional primary material, and a research platform that facilitates new teaching and research opportunities centered on the maps in the collection.

The working group seeks a **frontend web developer** focused on UI/UX and interface design to build the first public version of the portal, with the close collaboration of the project team. The project partners seek visually creative designs that draw inspiration from the map collections and emphasize ease of use for both specialist and nonspecialist public audiences.

_Project specifications_

* The project will be designed as a frontend web app to be hosted in a "serverless" ecosystem. Proposals should include a description of the team's preferred development framework, which may include static site generators such as Hugo or Javascript single page app environments such as Vue.
* A user-accessible web backend is not a requirement of the project, though the project team welcomes proposals for CMS integrations such as Forestry. At a minimum, the portal design should include the ability to include Markdown files in the build chain for creating original materials such as essays and articles.
* Access to primary source materials is provided via existing API access to the Leventhal Map & Education Center's digital collections portal. The project team has already created prototypes of search modules deriving access the digital collection portal's Search API, which returns JSON results; and its image server, which uses the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) protocol.
* In addition to customized search access into the digital collection resources, the portal should feature the ability to gather selected sets of digital collections objects into groupings such as galleries, carousels, and slideshows.
* The ability to embed deep zoomable images, using a IIIF viewer such as Mirador, TIFY, or OpenLayers, is a required feature.
* An initial wireframe (which is not meant to foreclose any design choices, nor to offer a final vision of the site's specifications, but instead to provide a mockup for some key functional areas) can be found [here](https://geoservices.leventhalmap.org/amrev-wireframe/).
* To the extent possible, the project should comply with Web Accessibility standards.

_Project supervision_

* Primary supervision of the web portal development will be conducted by Garrett Dash Nelson (Curator of Maps & Director of Geographic Scholarship, LMEC) and James Ambuske (Center for Digital History, George Washington's Mount Vernon). Both project members have experience in web development and digital humanities projects, and will be collaborating in designing the architecture of the portal.
* Overall supervision of the project is conducted by a Steering Committee consisting of leadership staff from both LMEC and Mount Vernon.
* Some limited support and consultation is available from the Boston Public Library staff that maintain the Digital Collections portal
