### Now accepting donations to the Weaver Fund

In 2023, David Weaver worked with LMEC staff to establish the **David J. Weaver Research Fund**, a fund dedicated to expanding our knowledge of the history and practice of geographic information systems (GIS). The Fund is closely linked to two archival collections which document the history of computer cartography, also donated by Weaver: the [David Judkins Weaver papers](https://archives.bpl.org/repositories/2/resources/153/collection_organization) and the [Applied Geographics, Inc. Records](https://archives.bpl.org/repositories/2/resources/152). 

The Weaver Fund has two main objectives:

- First, to **document history** of GIS development, both via Weaverâ€™s collections at the Leventhal Center, and through connecting our these collections with other important stories and materials outside of the BPL.
- Second, to help us **build for the future of computer cartography collections** by continuing to drive collections development through publication of original GIS research in the form of public scholarship, notably through a [research award starting in 2026](/research/weaver-gis-research-fellowship), made possible thanks to the Weaver Fund.

Please consider donating today to support our educational programming and public-facing research into the history of digital mapping.
