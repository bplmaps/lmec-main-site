The names of the stations on the map of the T are iconic landmarks of Boston's geography. But have you ever thought you could come up with more interesting names?  In the month of November, we're asking you to help us pick newly imagined station names through a fundraising auction that will support educational programming in our [_Getting Around Town_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/) exhibition. Whether you want to rename Oak Grove to Middlesex Fells, show some college rivalry by turning Northeastern station into Wentworth, or simply put your own name on top of Downtown Crossing, this is your chance to make the station names your own.

Get started by placing a $5 or $10 bid on your favorite station on the Red, Orange, Green, or Blue lines. The highest bidder for each station will choose the new name and will receive a copy of the final re-named map. A large-format version of the map will hang in our gallery for the rest of the _Getting Around Town_ exhibition and become part of the Leventhal Center's digital collections. View the [full list of stations here and choose one](https://lmec.betterworld.org/auctions/transit-fundraiser) to make your first bid!

Submit your bid by **midnight on Tuesday, November 28**, when the auction ends. Proposed names can be any phrase up to 64 characters (though they must be appropriate for all audiences). All proceeds from this auction will support free public and educational programs at the Leventhal Map & Education Center connected to our [_Getting Around Town_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/) exhibition on public transit.

**Giving Tuesday is right around the corner, and your generosity will go a long way to furthering our mission. Thank you for your support.**

Auction winners will be renaming stations on a special commemorative map that will be included in the _Getting Around Town_ exhibition. This auction in no way implies any right to the official renaming of stations by the MBTA itself, and no part of this auction should be construed to reflect any rights to renaming of public property.
