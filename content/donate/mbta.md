title: Rename the MBTA Map
---

### Put your name on the map in our November fundraiser

The names of the stations of the MBTA map are iconic landmarks of Boston's geography. But have you ever thought you could come up with more interesting names?  In the month of November, we're asking you to help us re-name the stations of the MBTA through a fundraising auction that will support educational programming in our [_Getting Around Town_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/) exhibition. Whether you want to rename Oak Grove to Middlesex Fells, show some college rivalry by turning Northeastern station into Wentworth, or simply put your own name on top of Downtown Crossing, this is your chance to make the station names your own.

Get started by placing a $5 or $10 bid on your favorite station on the Red, Orange, Green, or Blue lines. The highest bidder for each station will choose the new name and will receive a copy of the final re-named map, and a large-format version of the map will hang in our gallery for the rest of the _Getting Around Town_ exhibition. View the [full list of stations here and choose one](https://lmec.betterworld.org/auctions/transit-fundraiser) to make your first bid!

Submit your bid by **midnight on Tuesday, November 28**, when the auction ends. Proposed names can be any phrase up to 64 characters. All proceeds from the auction support free public and educational programs at the Leventhal Map & Education Center connected to our [_Getting Around Town_](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/getting-around-town/) exhibition on public transit.

**Giving Tuesday is right around the corner, and your generosity will go a long way to furthering our mission. Thank you for your support.**

#### More information

* We've made some editorial choices to omit the Silver Line and commuter rail lines, and we've trimmed off the long ends of the Green Line, simply to keep the number of stops manageable.
* This is an educational fundraiser for the Leventhal Map & Education Center and in no way an official project of the MBTA. The renamed stations will be appearing on a special edition map for the _Getting Around Town_ exhibition, but this auction in no way implies any official renaming of stations by the MBTA itself.
* The Leventhal Center, at its sole discretion, may reject proposed names that contain hate speech or content that is inapporpriate for young audiences.
