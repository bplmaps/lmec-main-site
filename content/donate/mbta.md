title: Re-name the MBTA
---

Have you ever thought you could come up with more interesting names for Boston's T stations? Today, you can! For the whole month of November, we're asking you to help us re-name the stations of the MBTA. Get started by placing a $5 or $10 bid on your favorite stations on the Red, Orange, Green or Blue lines. The highest bidder for each station will choose the new name and will receive a copy of the final re-named map. All stations that will be included can be seen on the map above. View the [full list of stations here and choose one ](https://lmec.betterworld.org/auctions/transit-fundraiser)to make your first bid!

Submit your bid by **midnight on Tuesday, November 28**, when the auction ends. Names should be appropriate and between X and X characters. All gifts support free public and educational programs at the Leventhal Map & Education Center. **Giving Tuesday is right around the corner, and your generosity will go a long way to furthering our mission. Thank you for your support.**
