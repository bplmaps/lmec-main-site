Have you ever thought you could come up with more interesting names for Boston's T stations? Today, you can! For the whole month of November, we're asking you to help us re-name the stations of the MBTA. Get started by placing a $5 or $10 bid on your favorite stations on the Red, Orange, Green or Blue lines. The highest bid for each station will choose the new name and will receive a copy of the final re-named map. Click on a station on the map above to place your first bid, or view the [full list of stations here](https://lmec.betterworld.org/auctions/transit-fundraiser).

Submit your bid by **midnight on Tuesday, November 28**, when the auction ends. Names should be appropriate and between X and X characters. All gifts support free public and educational programs at the Leventhal Map & Education Center. **Giving Tuesday is right around the corner, and your generosity will go a long way to furthering our mission. Thank you for your support.**
