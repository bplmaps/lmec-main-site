## Sponsor an Atlas

The Leventhal Center has an extraordinary collection of [urban atlases](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&f%5Bcollection_name_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Urban+Maps+%28Collection+of+Distinction%29&f%5Bsubject_facet_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Boston+%28Mass.%29--Maps&search_field=dummy_range&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bbegin%5D=1860&range%5Bdate_facet_yearly_itim%5D%5Bend%5D=1950&commit=Apply) dating from the late 19th to early 20th centuries, one of the most important sets of documents for depicting how our city and region have changed over time. Our [Atlascope tool](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org/) transforms 101 of these atlases into a web interface suitable for browsing on a computer or mobile device, making it easy to compare properties, buildings and owners to tell stories about places over time. With new features to empower storytelling, annotation, and discovery, as well as connections into other Massachusetts digital collections, Atlascope is a great tool to answer questions about property ownership, genealogy, urban transformation, and broad questions about historic and geographic change over time.

Boston City Archaeologist Joe Bagley uses Atlascope frequently in his work, [describing it as an invaluable tool](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/archaeology-and-atlascope/) for his historic research. In 2020, Atlascope helped Bagley uncover the [origins of a mysterious sinkhole](https://www.boston.gov/news/update-ronan-park-well) that appeared in Ronan Park in Dorchester and the subsequent [discovery of a 19th century well.](https://www.wcvb.com/article/archaeologists-discover-forgotten-well-inside-sinkhole-in-dorchesters-ronan-park/34931536#)

_Above, you can see the property of Mary Pierce in 1889 overlaid on a present day Ronan Park in Dorchester, an important clue for Bagley when figuring out the origins of the sinkhole._

Students and individuals of all ages also use Atlascope all the time. Last summer, the Boston Preservation Alliance also used Atlascope in partnership with Boston Public School students from the Lilla G. Frederick Pilot Middle School. [Students used Atlascope and other primary sources to explore Grove Hall, Uphamâ€™s Corner, and Fields Corner to tell stories about these Dorchester neighborhoods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak0nDQpNOe0). Individual researchers and university classes use Atlascope for in-depth research projects around urban change, local history, and ; For example, students at [College of the Holy Cross completed a semester-long research project](https://www.leventhalmap.org/articles/before-displacement-part-two/) about the buildings and landscapes of Boston that were destroyed by the Central Artery.

Finally, patrons from all over the city use Atlascope, researching their family histories, satiating curiosities about historical change, and finding new stories that emerge from the woodwork when examining these fascinating cartographic items.

**Are there atlases of other Massachusetts towns you would like to see added to Atlascope?** The Leventhal Center is currently in the process of digitizing and geotransforming historic atlases from towns and counties across the state of Massachusetts, to **ingest into Atlascope for usage and discovery once the necessary support is secured**. **If you would like to help support or be a part of this project, please fill out this form below, and a member our staff will be in touch with you.**
