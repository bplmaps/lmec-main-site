The digital exhibition for our previous show, **Bending Lines**, was designed as an online-first experience. It features zoomable, high-resolution images of all of the exhibition objects; interactive features like a [projection explorer](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/how-to-bend/projections/) and a [map trust exercise](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/how-to-bend/interactive-trust/); [video presentations](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/events/) from the curator and guests; and activities [designed specially for K-12 educators](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/education-activities/).
