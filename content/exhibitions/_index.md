We regularly mount exhibitions in our gallery, [located in the historic McKim Building](about/hours-directions) the Boston Public Library in Copley Square. Exhibitions topics range from collections-centered shows on [Boston bird's eye views](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/16) and [women mapmakers](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/6) to theme-centered shows on the [American Revolution](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/3), [Boston immigration](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/19), and [public landscapes](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/19). All of our exhibitions feature scholarly research as well as activities for families, children, and educators.

## Rotating Exhibition

### *Terrains of Independence*

**March 2025 – March 2026**

In 1775, a collision of word-historical forces, driven by ocean-spanning empires, conflicts over trade and settlement, and new ideas about society and government, came together in the spark of the American Revolution. Yet although both the causes and the consequences of the Revolution were grand in scale, the war ignited in the tinderbox of a very specific local geography: Boston and the surrounding towns of Massachusetts. Why did it happen here? The revolutionary moment was as much about places as it was about people or ideas. In and around Boston, the tensions of Britain’s colonial empire had been rising for decades before the 1770s. The commercial geography of the city and its region, zones of friction between classes and communities, and contestations over the environment all helped to create the conditions that led to an era of revolutionary upheaval in Massachusetts. In the Leventhal Map & Education Center’s exhibition *Terrains of Independence*, maps will offer the entry point to a reconsideration of the Revolutionary War through the lens of locality and place.

## Permanent Exhibition

### *Becoming Boston: Eight Moments in the Geography of a Changing City*

Maps trace out the complicated history of places, and we can use them to document geography in much the same way that we can use diaries and letters to document biography. In the eight cases of this exhibition, we follow the changing spatial forms of the place we now call Boston—from before the landscape carried that name all the way through the struggles, clashes, and dreams that continue to reshape the city today. These maps don’t merely depict facts about how the city looked at different moments in its history. Instead, they invite us to contemplate how geographic forces, both natural and human, have constructed the physical and social world around us, through large and small transformations that have transpired over many centuries.
