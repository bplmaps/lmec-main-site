## Currently on Exhibit

### _More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape_

**March 18–December 28, 2022**

In [_More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape_,](https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/more-or-less-in-common/) we take a look at how questions of social justice and injustice are essential topics to confront when trying to understand the human landscape. These questions must also be at the center of our attention as we challenge ourselves to build better, healthier environments in the future. Through maps as well as photographs, images, and data visualizations, this exhibition encourages you to confront stories about how environmental conditions have sometimes served to worsen inequalities along lines of social division. At the same time, our shared environment offers the possibility to bring people together across differences and the inspiration to forge new kinds of common action.

The Stony Brook watershed, shown in blue on [this 1860s map](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:cj82m029n), crossed multiple then-independent towns, raising questions about what happens when social and ecological boundaries cross each other." >}}

## Coming Soon

### _Soft City_

**December 1–December 28, 2022**

_Soft City_ by [just practice](https://justpractice.work/) is "a large-scale textile series that maps the urban fabric of Black neighborhoods in the Boston area. The tapestries map historic (redlined) and contemporary Black neighborhoods, including Roxbury, Dorchester, and East Cambridge. The information mapped tells the story of the past, present and future of Black residents, and the ecological resilience of the neighborhoods they live in. Hard (impervious) and soft (pervious) land uses are codified using colors with overlays of Black residents and flood zones on the tapestries. The softness and materiality of tufting interrogates the traditional top-down approach to space planning and management in the city and offers new tactile ways to explore our understanding of urban space, at all ages.”

### _Building Blocks: Boston Stories from Urban Atlases_

**January 13–August 19, 2023**

In the period spanning the Civil War to World War II, Boston’s urban fabric experienced profound changes. _Building Blocks_ travels to different areas of metropolitan Boston from the 1870s to the 1930s for an episodic view of history, illuminating the many stories that are preserved in the atlases. Beyond the stories narrated in this exhibition, the rich details of the atlases help modern viewers imagine what one’s own story in a rapidly developing city might have looked like during a moment steeped in change.

These atlases display property, street, utility, and building information—details which reflect their original purpose as maps for the fire insurance and real estate industries." class="figure-center" >}}

### _Becoming Boston: Eight Moments in the Geography of a Changing City_

**Permanent Exhibition opens January 13, 2022**

Maps trace out the complicated history of places, and we can use them to document geography in much the same way that we can use diaries and letters to document biography. In the eight cases of this exhibition, we follow the changing spatial forms of the place we now call Boston—from before the landscape carried that name all the way through the struggles, clashes, and dreams that continue to reshape the city today. These maps don’t merely depict facts about how the city looked at different moments in its history. Instead, they invite us to contemplate how geographic forces, both natural and human, have constructed the physical and social world around us, through large and small transformations that have transpired over many centuries.
