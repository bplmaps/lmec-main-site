We regularly mount exhibitions in our gallery, [located in the historic McKim Building](about/hours-directions) the Boston Public Library in Copley Square. Exhibitions topics range from collections-centered shows on [Boston bird's eye views](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/16) and [women mapmakers](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/6) to theme-centered shows on the [American Revolution](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/3), [Boston immigration](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/19), and [public landscapes](https://collections.leventhalmap.org/exhibits/19). All of our exhibitions feature scholarly research as well as activities for families, children, and educators.

## Currently on Exhibit

<div class="callout my-3">Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception</div>

Because they seem to show the world how it “really is,” maps produce a powerful sense of trust and belief. But maps and data visualizations can never communicate a truth without any perspective at all. They are social objects whose meaning and power are produced by written and symbolic language and whose authority is determined by the institutions and contexts in which they circulate. **Bending Lines: Maps and Data from Distortion to Deception** examines the many ways in which maps and data can bend the lines of reality.

**Bending Lines** was scheduled to be exhibited in May 2020, but was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have created an immersive digital-first exhibition portal to explore while the gallery is closed.
