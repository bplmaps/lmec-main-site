### In-person access remains closed

Currently, no in-person access to the Map Center's gallery, learning center, or research collections is available. The Boston Public Library is closed for regular service; however, holds pickup for circulating material is available under the BPL To Go program. Learn more about BPL To Go and the status of the BPL system at [the BPL website](https://www.bpl.org/news/bpl-to-go/).

### Digital and remote services available

The Map Center has made extensive efforts to continue research, educational, and exhibition activities in a remote setting. Throughout our website, you'll find information on how to access digitized material, explore research collections, and teach with maps at the K-12 and university levels. In particular, you may want to see the pages on:

* \[Teach It Yourself\](education/k12/teach-it-yourself) for K-12 classes
