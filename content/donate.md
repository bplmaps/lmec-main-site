## Donations

As a non-profit that offers services "free to all", we rely on the support of donors like you to keep our exhibitions and educational programs running. Please consider [making a gift today. Donate here.](https://mapsbpl.thankyou4caring.org/)

The Annual Fund of the Leventhal Map & Education Center helps make possible exhibitions, educational, digital, research, and conservation programs for thousands of visitors, students, teachers and researchers who visit us in person and online each year. Here are a few examples of what your Annual Fund gift can accomplish:

$50 supports free reference and research inquiries

$100 creates a durable study map to use in classrooms

$500 sends one of our educators to a Boston Public School to co-teach a workshop

$1,000 develops the interpretation and display of a historical map in an exhibition

With your gift, youâ€™ll receive our heartfelt thanks, invitations to programs and exhibitions, and our monthly e-newsletter.
